Yamale does not protect against intentionally malicious schemas. |\n|:------------|\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/github.com\/23andMe\/Yamale\/blob\/master\/yamale.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Yamale\" width=\"400\"\/>\n\nA schema and validator for YAML.\n\nWhat's YAML? See the current spec [here](http:\/\/www.yaml.org\/spec\/1.2\/spec.html) and an introduction\nto the syntax [here](https:\/\/github.com\/Animosity\/CraftIRC\/wiki\/Complete-idiot's-introduction-to-yaml).\n\n[![Build Status](https:\/\/github.com\/23andMe\/Yamale\/actions\/workflows\/run-tests.yml\/badge.svg)](https:\/\/github.com\/23andMe\/Yamale\/actions\/workflows\/run-tests.yml)\n[![PyPI](https:\/\/img.shields.io\/pypi\/v\/yamale.svg)](https:\/\/pypi.python.org\/pypi\/yamale)\n\nRequirements\n------------\n* Python 3.8+\n* PyYAML\n* ruamel.yaml (optional)\n\nInstall\n-------\n### pip\n```bash\n$ pip install yamale\n```\n\nNOTE: Some platforms, e.g., Mac OS, may ship with only Python 2 and may not have pip installed.\nInstallation of Python 3 should also install pip. To preserve any system dependencies on default\nsoftware, consider installing Python 3 as a local package. Please note replacing system-provided\nPython may disrupt other software. Mac OS users may wish to investigate MacPorts, homebrew, or\nbuilding Python 3 from source; in all three cases, Apple's Command Line Tools (CLT) for Xcode\nmay be required. See also [developers](#developers), below.\n\n### Manual\n1. Download Yamale from: https:\/\/github.com\/23andMe\/Yamale\/archive\/master.zip\n2. Unzip somewhere temporary\n3. Run `python setup.py install` (may have to prepend `sudo`)\n\nUsage\n-----\n### Command line\nYamale can be run from the command line to validate one or many YAML files. Yamale will search the\ndirectory you supply (current directory is default) for YAML files. Each YAML file it finds it will\nlook in the same directory as that file for its schema, if there is no schema Yamale will keep\nlooking up the directory tree until it finds one. If Yamale can not find a schema it will tell you.\n\nUsage:\n\n```bash\nusage: yamale [-h] [-s SCHEMA] [-n CPU_NUM] [-p PARSER] [--no-strict] [PATH]\n\nValidate yaml files.\n\npositional arguments:\n  PATH                  folder to validate. Default is current directory.\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  -s SCHEMA, --schema SCHEMA\n                        filename of schema. Default is schema.yaml.\n  -n CPU_NUM, --cpu-num CPU_NUM\n                        number of CPUs to use. Default is 4.\n  -p PARSER, --parser PARSER\n                        YAML library to load files. Choices are \"ruamel\" or\n                        \"pyyaml\" (default).\n  --no-strict           Disable strict mode, unexpected elements in the data\n                        will be accepted.\n```\n\n### API\nThere are several ways to feed Yamale schema and data files. The simplest way is to let Yamale take\ncare of reading and parsing your YAML files.\n\nAll you need to do is supply the files' path:\n```python\n# Import Yamale and make a schema object:\nimport yamale\nschema = yamale.make_schema('.\/schema.yaml')\n\n# Create a Data object\ndata = yamale.make_data('.\/data.yaml')\n\n# Validate data against the schema. Throws a ValueError if data is invalid.\nyamale.validate(schema, data)\n```\n\nYou can pass a string of YAML to `make_schema()` and `make_data()` instead of passing a file path\nby using the `content=` parameter:\n\n```python\ndata = yamale.make_data(content=\"\"\"\nname: Bill\nage: 26\nheight: 6.2\nawesome: True\n\"\"\")\n```\n\nIf `data` is valid, nothing will happen. However, if `data` is invalid Yamale will throw a\n`YamaleError` with a message containing all the invalid nodes:\n```python\ntry:\n    yamale.validate(schema, data)\n    print('Validation success! \ud83d\udc4d')\nexcept ValueError as e:\n    print('Validation failed!\\n%s' % str(e))\n    exit(1)\n```\nand an array of `ValidationResult`.\n```python\ntry:\n    yamale.validate(schema, data)\n    print('Validation success! \ud83d\udc4d')\nexcept YamaleError as e:\n    print('Validation failed!\\n')\n    for result in e.results:\n        print(\"Error validating data '%s' with '%s'\\n\\t\" % (result.data, result.schema))\n        for error in result.errors:\n            print('\\t%s' % error)\n    exit(1)\n```\n\nYou can also specify an optional `parser` if you'd like to use the `ruamel.yaml` (YAML 1.2 support) instead:\n```python\n# Import Yamale and make a schema object, make sure ruamel.yaml is installed already.\nimport yamale\nschema = yamale.make_schema('.\/schema.yaml', parser='ruamel')\n\n# Create a Data object\ndata = yamale.make_data('.\/data.yaml', parser='ruamel')\n\n# Validate data against the schema same as before.\nyamale.validate(schema, data)\n```\n\n### Schema\n\n| :warning: Ensure that your schema definitions come from internal or trusted sources. Yamale does not protect against intentionally malicious schemas. |\n|:------------|\n\nTo use Yamale you must make a schema. A schema is a valid YAML file with one or more documents\ninside. Each node terminates in a string which contains valid Yamale syntax. For example, `str()`\nrepresents a [String validator](#validators).\n\nA basic schema:\n```yaml\nname: str()\nage: int(max=200)\nheight: num()\nawesome: bool()\n```\n\nAnd some YAML that validates:\n```yaml\nname: Bill\nage: 26\nheight: 6.2\nawesome: True\n```\n\nTake a look at the [Examples](#examples) section for more complex schema ideas.\n\n#### Includes\nSchema files may contain more than one YAML document (nodes separated by `---`). The first document\nfound will be the base schema. Any additional documents will be treated as Includes. Includes allow\nyou to define a valid structure once and use it several times. They also allow you to do recursion.\n\nA schema with an Include validator:\n```yaml\nperson1: include('person')\nperson2: include('person')\n---\nperson:\n    name: str()\n    age: int()\n```\n\nSome valid YAML:\n```yaml\nperson1:\n    name: Bill\n    age: 70\n\nperson2:\n    name: Jill\n    age: 20\n```\n\nEvery root node not in the first YAML document will be treated like an include:\n```yaml\nperson: include('friend')\ngroup: include('family')\n---\nfriend:\n    name: str()\nfamily:\n    name: str()\n```\n\nIs equivalent to:\n```yaml\nperson: include('friend')\ngroup: include('family')\n---\nfriend:\n    name: str()\n---\nfamily:\n    name: str()\n```\n\n##### Recursion\nYou can get recursion using the Include validator.\n\nThis schema:\n```yaml\nperson: include('human')\n---\nhuman:\n    name: str()\n    age: int()\n    friend: include('human', required=False)\n```\n\nWill validate this data:\n```yaml\nperson:\n    name: Bill\n    age: 50\n    friend:\n        name: Jill\n        age: 20\n        friend:\n            name: Will\n            age: 10\n```\n\n##### Adding external includes\nAfter you construct a schema you can add extra, external include definitions by calling\n`schema.add_include(dict)`. This method takes a dictionary and adds each key as another include.\n\n### Strict mode\nBy default Yamale will provide errors for extra elements present in lists and maps that are not\ncovered by the schema. With strict mode disabled (using the `--no-strict` command line option),\nadditional elements will not cause any errors. In the API, strict mode can be toggled by passing\nthe strict=True\/False flag to the validate function.\n\nIt is possible to mix strict and non-strict mode by setting the strict=True\/False flag in the\ninclude validator, setting the option only for the included validators.\n\nValidators\n----------\nHere are all the validators Yamale knows about. Every validator takes a `required` keyword telling\nYamale whether or not that node must exist. By default every node is required. Example: `str(required=False)`\n\nYou can also require that an optional value is not `None` by using the `none` keyword. By default\nYamale will accept `None` as a valid value for a key that's not required. Reject `None` values\nwith `none=False` in any validator. Example: `str(required=False, none=False)`.\n\nSome validators take keywords and some take arguments, some take both. For instance the `enum()`\nvalidator takes one or more constants as arguments and the `required` keyword:\n`enum('a string', 1, False, required=False)`\n\n### String - `str(min=int, max=int, equals=string, starts_with=string, ends_with=string, matches=regex, exclude=string, ignore_case=False, multiline=False, dotall=False)`\nValidates strings.\n- keywords\n    - `min`: len(string) >= min\n    - `max`: len(string) <= max\n    - `equals`: string == value (add `ignore_case=True` for case-insensitive checking)\n    - `starts_with`: Accepts only strings starting with given value (add `ignore_case=True` for\n      case-insensitive checking)\n    - `matches`: Validates the string against a given regex. Similar to the `regex()` validator,\n      you can use `ignore_case`, `multiline` and `dotall`)\n    - `ends_with`: Accepts only strings ending with given value (add `ignore_case=True` for case-insensitive checking)\n    - `exclude`: Rejects strings that contains any character in the excluded value\n    - `ignore_case`: Validates strings in a case-insensitive manner.\n    - `multiline`: `^` and `$` in a pattern match at the beginning and end of each line in a string\n       in addition to matching at the beginning and end of the entire string. (A pattern matches\n       at [the beginning of a string](https:\/\/docs.python.org\/3\/library\/re.html#re.match) even in\n       multiline mode; see below for a workaround.); only allowed in conjunction with a `matches` keyword.\n    - `dotall`: `.` in a pattern matches newline characters in a validated string in addition to\n      matching every character that *isn't* a newline.; only allowed in conjunction with a `matches` keyword.\n\nExamples:\n- `str(max=10, exclude='?!')`: Allows only strings less than 11 characters that don't contain `?` or `!`.\n\n### Regex - `regex([patterns], name=string, ignore_case=False, multiline=False, dotall=False)`\nValidates strings against one or more regular expressions.\n- arguments: one or more Python regular expression patterns\n- keywords:\n    - `name`: A friendly description for the patterns.\n    - `ignore_case`: Validates strings in a case-insensitive manner.\n    - `multiline`: `^` and `$` in a pattern match at the beginning and end of each line in a string\n       in addition to matching at the beginning and end of the entire string. (A pattern matches\n       at [the beginning of a string](https:\/\/docs.python.org\/3\/library\/re.html#re.match) even in\n       multiline mode; see below for a workaround.)\n    - `dotall`: `.` in a pattern matches newline characters in a validated string in addition to\n      matching every character that *isn't* a newline.\n\nExamples:\n- `regex('^[^?!]{,10}$')`: Allows only strings less than 11 characters that don't contain `?` or `!`.\n- `regex(r'^(\\d+)(\\s\\1)+$', name='repeated natural')`: Allows only strings that contain two or\n  more identical digit sequences, each separated by a whitespace character. Non-matching strings\n  like `sugar` are rejected with a message like `'sugar' is not a repeated natural.`\n- `regex('.*^apples$', multiline=True, dotall=True)`: Allows the string `apples` as well\n  as multiline strings that contain the line `apples`.\n\n### Integer - `int(min=int, max=int)`\nValidates integers.\n- keywords\n    - `min`: int >= min\n    - `max`: int <= max\n\n### Number - `num(min=float, max=float)`\nValidates integers and floats.\n- keywords\n    - `min`: num >= min\n    - `max`: num <= max\n\n### Boolean - `bool()`\nValidates booleans.\n\n### Null - `null()`\nValidates null values.\n\n### Enum - `enum([primitives])`\nValidates from a list of constants.\n- arguments: constants to test equality with\n\nExamples:\n- `enum('a string', 1, False)`: a value can be either `'a string'`, `1` or `False`\n\n### Day - `day(min=date, max=date)`\nValidates a date in the form of YYYY-MM-DD.\n- keywords\n    - `min`: date >= min\n    - `max`: date <= max\n\nExamples:\n- `day(min='2001-01-01', max='2100-01-01')`: Only allows dates between 2001-01-01 and 2100-01-01.\n\n### Timestamp - `timestamp(min=time, max=time)`\nValidates a timestamp in the form of YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.\n- keywords\n    - `min`: time >= min\n    - `max`: time <= max\n\nExamples:\n- `timestamp(min='2001-01-01 01:00:00', max='2100-01-01 23:00:00')`: Only allows times between\n  2001-01-01 01:00:00 and 2100-01-01 23:00:00.\n\n### List - `list([validators], min=int, max=int)`\nValidates lists. If one or more validators are passed to `list()` only nodes that pass at\nleast one of those validators will be accepted.\n\n- arguments: one or more validators to test values with\n- keywords\n    - `min`: len(list) >= min\n    - `max`: len(list) <= max\n\nExamples:\n- `list()`: Validates any list\n- `list(include('custom'), int(), min=4)`: Only validates lists that contain the `custom` include\n  or integers and contains a minimum of 4 items.\n\n### Map - `map([validators], key=validator, min=int, max=int)`\nValidates maps. Use when you want a node to contain freeform data. Similar to `List`, `Map` takes\none or more validators to run against the values of its nodes, and only nodes that pass at least\none of those validators will be accepted. By default, only the values of nodes are validated and\nthe keys aren't checked.\n- arguments: one or more validators to test values with\n- keywords\n    - `key`: A validator for the keys of the map.\n    - `min`: len(map) >= min\n    - `max`: len(map) <= max\n\nExamples:\n- `map()`: Validates any map\n- `map(str(), int())`: Only validates maps whose values are strings or integers.\n- `map(str(), key=int())`: Only validates maps whose keys are integers and values are strings. `1: one` would be valid but `'1': one` would not.\n- `map(str(), min=1)`: Only validates a non-empty map.\n\n### IP Address - `ip()`\nValidates IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.\n\n- keywords\n    - `version`: 4 or 6; explicitly force IPv4 or IPv6 validation\n\nExamples:\n- `ip()`: Allows any valid IPv4 or IPv6 address\n- `ip(version=4)`: Allows any valid IPv4 address\n- `ip(version=6)`: Allows any valid IPv6 address\n\n### MAC Address - `mac()`\nValidates MAC addresses.\n\nExamples:\n- `mac()`: Allows any valid MAC address\n\n### SemVer (Semantic Versioning) - `semver()`\nValidates [Semantic Versioning](https:\/\/semver.org\/) strings.\n\nExamples:\n- `semver()`: Allows any valid SemVer string\n\n### Any - `any([validators])`\nValidates against a union of types. Use when a node **must** contain **one and only one** of several types. It is valid\nif at least one of the listed validators is valid. If no validators are given, accept any value.\n- arguments: validators to test values with (if none is given, allow any value; if one or more are given,\none must be present)\n\nExamples:\n- `any(int(), null())`: Validates either an integer **or** a null value.\n- `any(num(), include('vector'))`: Validates **either** a number **or** an included 'vector' type.\n- `any(str(min=3, max=3),str(min=5, max=5),str(min=7, max=7))`: validates to a string that is exactly 3, 5, or 7 characters long\n- `any()`: Allows any value.\n\n### Subset - `subset([validators], allow_empty=False)`\nValidates against a subset of types. Unlike the `Any` validator, this validators allows **one or more** of several types.\nAs such, it *automatically validates against a list*. It is valid if all values can be validated against at least one\nvalidator.\n- arguments: validators to test with (at least one; if none is given, a `ValueError` exception will be raised)\n- keywords:\n    - `allow_empty`: Allow the subset to be empty (and is, therefore, also optional). This overrides the `required`\nflag.\n\nExamples:\n- `subset(int(), str())`: Validators against an integer, a string, or a list of either.\n- `subset(int(), str(), allow_empty=True)`: Same as above, but allows the empty set and makes the subset optional.\n\n### Include - `include(include_name)`\nValidates included structures. Must supply the name of a valid include.\n- arguments: single name of a defined include, surrounded by quotes.\n\nExamples:\n- `include('person')`\n\n### Custom validators\nIt is also possible to add your own custom validators. This is an advanced topic, but here is an\nexample of adding a `Date` validator and using it in a schema as `date()`\n\n```python\nimport yamale\nimport datetime\nfrom yamale.validators import DefaultValidators, Validator\n\nclass Date(Validator):\n    \"\"\" Custom Date validator \"\"\"\n    tag = 'date'\n\n    def _is_valid(self, value):\n        return isinstance(value, datetime.date)\n\nvalidators = DefaultValidators.copy()  # This is a dictionary\nvalidators[Date.tag] = Date\nschema = yamale.make_schema('.\/schema.yaml', validators=validators)\n# Then use `schema` as normal\n```\n\nExamples\n--------\n\n| :warning: Ensure that your schema definitions come from internal or trusted sources. Yamale does not protect against intentionally malicious schemas. |\n|:------------|\n\n### Using keywords\n#### Schema:\n```yaml\noptional: str(required=False)\noptional_min: int(min=1, required=False)\nmin: num(min=1.5)\nmax: int(max=100)\n```\n#### Valid Data:\n```yaml\noptional_min: 10\nmin: 1.6\nmax: 100\n```\n\n### Includes and recursion\n#### Schema:\n```yaml\ncustomerA: include('customer')\ncustomerB: include('customer')\nrecursion: include('recurse')\n---\ncustomer:\n    name: str()\n    age: int()\n    custom: include('custom_type')\n\ncustom_type:\n    integer: int()\n\nrecurse:\n    level: int()\n    again: include('recurse', required=False)\n```\n#### Valid Data:\n```yaml\ncustomerA:\n    name: bob\n    age: 900\n    custom:\n        integer: 1\ncustomerB:\n    name: jill\n    age: 1\n    custom:\n        integer: 3\nrecursion:\n    level: 1\n    again:\n        level: 2\n        again:\n            level: 3\n            again:\n                level: 4\n```\n\n### Lists\n#### Schema:\n```yaml\nlist_with_two_types: list(str(), include('variant'))\nquestions: list(include('question'))\n---\nvariant:\n  rsid: str()\n  name: str()\n\nquestion:\n  choices: list(include('choices'))\n  questions: list(include('question'), required=False)\n\nchoices:\n  id: str()\n```\n#### Valid Data:\n```yaml\nlist_with_two_types:\n  - 'some'\n  - rsid: 'rs123'\n    name: 'some SNP'\n  - 'thing'\n  - rsid: 'rs312'\n    name: 'another SNP'\nquestions:\n  - choices:\n      - id: 'id_str'\n      - id: 'id_str1'\n    questions:\n      - choices:\n        - id: 'id_str'\n        - id: 'id_str1'\n```\n\n### The data is a list of items without a keyword at the top level\n#### Schema:\n```yaml\nlist(include('human'), min=2, max=2)\n\n---\nhuman:\n  name: str()\n  age: int(max=200)\n  height: num()\n  awesome: bool()\n```\n#### Valid Data:\n```yaml\n- name: Bill\n  age: 26\n  height: 6.2\n  awesome: True\n\n- name: Adrian\n  age: 23\n  height: 6.3\n  awesome: True\n```\n\nWriting Tests\n-------------\nTo validate YAML files when you run your program's tests use Yamale's YamaleTestCase\n\nExample:\n\n```python\nclass TestYaml(YamaleTestCase):\n    base_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))\n    schema = 'schema.yaml'\n    yaml = 'data.yaml'\n    # or yaml = ['data-*.yaml', 'some_data.yaml']\n\n    def runTest(self):\n        self.assertTrue(self.validate())\n```\n\n`base_dir`: String path to prepend to all other paths. This is optional.\n\n`schema`: String of path to the schema file to use. One schema file per test case.\n\n`yaml`: String or list of yaml files to validate. Accepts globs.\n\nDevelopers\n----------\n### Linting + Formatting\nYamale is formatted with [ruff](https:\/\/github.com\/astral-sh\/ruff). There is a github action enforcing\nruff formatting and linting rules. You can run this locally via `make lint` or by installing\nthe pre-commit hooks via `make install-hooks`\n\n### Testing\nYamale uses [Tox](https:\/\/tox.readthedocs.org\/en\/latest\/) to run its tests against multiple Python\nversions. To run tests, first checkout Yamale, install Tox, then run `make test` in Yamale's root\ndirectory. You may also have to install the correct Python versions to test with as well.\n\nNOTE on Python versions: `tox.ini` specifies the lowest and highest versions of Python supported by\nYamale. Unless your development environment is configured to support testing against multiple Python\nversions, one or more of the test branches may fail. One method of enabling testing against multiple\nversions of Python is to install `pyenv` and `tox-pyenv` and to use `pyenv install` and `pyenv local`\nto ensure that tox is able to locate appropriate Pythons.\n\n### Releasing\nYamale uses Github Actions to upload new tags to PyPi.\nTo release a new version:\n\n1. Make a commit with the new version number in `yamale\/VERSION`.\n1. Run tests for good luck.\n1. Run `make release`.\n\nGithub Actions will take care of the rest.\n",

Such\nconnection objects can be set up to connect to any kind of database backend\nsupported by SQLAlchemy using a database URI, such as Postgres, MySQL, Oracle,\nSQLite, MS-SQL, Firebird, Informix. However, some of these database backends\nhave not been tested with the SQLAlchemyDA, so your mileage may vary.\n\nIn addition to ZSQL support, the SQLAlchemyDA makes it possible to use the\nstandard SQLAlchemy API within a Zope context and participate in Zope\ntransactions.\n\nHowever, if you do not require ZSQL support, and only wish to call 'normal'\nSQLAlchemy APIs within Zope transactions, this package adds no value. Instead,\nyou would be better off trying out `zope.sqlalchemy`, as recommended in the\n`Zope book chapter on relational database\nconnectivity <http:\/\/docs.zope.org\/zope2\/zope2book\/RelationalDatabases.html>`_.\n\n\nRequirements:\n-------------\n\n- Zope 4+\n- SQLAlchemy >= 0.5.0 (+ database specific low-level Python drivers)\n- z3c.sqlalchemy >= 1.5.0\n\nTesting: testfixtures are needed to run tests.\n\n\nInstallation:\n-------------\n\n- Download and install SQLAlchemy as egg or from the sources\n  from PyPI (pip sqlalchemy). See\n    \n    http:\/\/www.sqlalchemy.org\n\n    for details\n\n- Download and install z3c.sqlalchemy as egg or from the sources \n  from PyPI (pip z3c.sqlalchemy). See\n\n    https:\/\/pypi.org\/project\/z3c.sqlalchemy\/\n\n  for details.\n\n- Unpack the archive containing SQLAlchemyDA inside the \"Products\"\n  directory of your Zope instance home.\n\n- After restarting Zope you go to the ZMI and create an instance of\n  \"SQLAlchemyDA\" (as you would create some DA instance)\n\n- Click on the new created SQLAlchemyDA instance within the ZMI\n  and configure your database connection through the \"Properties\" tab.\n  The connection parameter 'dsn' must be specified as a valid SQLAlchemy DSN \n  like\n\n         <dbschema>:\/\/<username>:<password>@<hostname>\/<databasename>\n\n    Example:\n        \n        postgres:\/\/admin:123@localhost:5432\/TestDB\n\n- ZSQL methods should see the new DA through the selection widget of available\n  database adapters\n\n- NOTE: you must have the low-level Python DB drivers installed in order to \n  access a particular database. See \n\n        http:\/\/www.sqlalchemy.org\/docs\/dbengine.html#dbengine_supported\n\n  for details.\n\n\nConfiguration of SQLAlchemyDA:\n------------------------------\n\n- 'dsn' - SQLAlchemy compliant Database Set Name (see www.sqlalchemy.org\/docs)\n\n- 'transactional' - uncheck this property if you are working with a non-transactional\n   database like older versions of MySQL. Uncheck this property *only* if you see any\n   commit() related error. Otherwise leave this property checked. Changing this\n   property *requires* a Zope restart.\n\n- 'quoting_style' - affects how strings are quoted in SQL. By default 'standard' \n   quotes strings correctly. Setting the value to 'no-quote' might solve quoting issues\n   with some databases.\n\n\nUsing SQLAlchemyDA:\n-------------------\n\nSQLAlchemyDA works as a database adapter as documented within \"The Zope Book\"\n\nhttps:\/\/zope.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/zopebook\/RelationalDatabases.html\n\nand can be used like any other DA together with ZSQL methods.\n\n\nTested with databases:\n----------------------\n\n- Postgres 7.4, 8.0-8.2\n- SQLite 3.3.X\n- Oracle 10g\n- MySQL is *only* supported for MySQL databases with transaction support.\n  (see also z3c\/sqlalchemy\/README.txt)\n- MSSQL 2008\n \n\nKnown issues:\n-------------\n\n\"\"\" Database connection could not be opened ((ProgrammingError) (1064, You\nhave an error in your SQL syntax near 'COMMIT .\n\"\"\"\n\nThis bug might appear with older MySQL versions when opening\/closing\nthe connections manually through the ZMI. It should not affect the\nfunctionality of SQLAlchemyDA.\n    \n\nAuthor\n------\n\nSQLAlchemyDA was written by Andreas Jung for Haufe Mediengruppe, Freiburg,\nGermany and ZOPYX Ltd. & Co.

For instance, you can bundle additional monitoring plugins to collect specialized data\nfrom your servers.\n\nWe also welcome submissions from the community.\n\nFor information on the agent architecture and code abstractions, please refer to the\n[architecture.md](docs\/architecture.md) document.\n\nSome of the tests and checks depend on on fixture file from git submodule so you should make sure you\nalso check out all the submodules:\n\n```bash\ngit submodule update --recursive --init\n```\n\n### Local Development Environment, Tests and Lint Checks\n\nThis repository utilizes ``tox`` Python project for running various lint checks and tests in\nisolated virtual environment.\n\nUnderneath, we use ``py.test`` test runner for running the tests.\n\nFor it to work, you need to have ``tox`` Python package installed on the system or inside the virtual\nenvironment which you use for the development.\n\n```bash\npip install tox\n```\n\nIn addition to that, you also need to have Python version available which is used for a particular\ntox target. By default Python 2.7 is used for the unit tests and Python 3.6 for all the lint checks.\n\nTo run all the checks you can simply run tox command:\n\n```bash\ntox\n```\n\nIn addition to that, you can also run a specific target or a set of targets using ``-e`` flag. For example:\n\n```bash\n# run all the lint targets\ntox -elint\n\n# run flake8 and mypy tox target\ntox -eflake8,mypy\n\n# run py2.7-unit-tests tox target\ntox -epy2.7-unit-tests\n\n# run coverage tox target\ntox -ecoverage\n```\n\nTo run a sub-set of tests or a single test from a test file, you can directly invoke ``pytest``\nfrom a specific tox virtual environment as shown below:\n\n```bash\n.tox\/py2.7-unit-tests\/bin\/py.test -vv --durations=5 \"<test file>::<test class name>\" -k \"<test method name>\"\n```\n\nFor example:\n\n```bash\n# This will run all the tests in tests\/unit\/url_monitor_test.py file\n.tox\/py2.7-unit-tests\/bin\/py.test -vv --durations=5 \"tests\/unit\/url_monitor_test.py\"\n\n# This will run all the test methods on the ``UrlMonitorTestRequest`` class in the\n# tests\/unit\/url_monitor_test.py file\n.tox\/py2.7-unit-tests\/bin\/py.test -vv --durations=5 \"tests\/unit\/url_monitor_test.py::UrlMonitorTestRequest\"\n\n# This will run ``UrlMonitorTestRequest.test_get_request_no_headers`` test method from the\n# tests\/unit\/url_monitor_test.py file\n.tox\/py2.7-unit-tests\/bin\/py.test -vv --durations=5 \"tests\/unit\/url_monitor_test.py::UrlMonitorTestRequest\" -k test_get_request_no_headers\n```\n\n### Continuous Integration\n\nWe run all the tox checks described above (+ more) continuously as part of our Github Actions based\nbuild system.\n\nEach push to a branch \/ pull request will trigger a build and a subset of the GHA jobs.\n\nAdditional jobs will run once the PR has been merged into master. The reason we do that is to\nspeed the PR builds and increase the developer feedback loop (some of the tests and checks we\nrun are slow so running them on every push to a branch would be slow and wasteful).\n\nBefore merging a pull request you need to ensure that all the checks have passed, pull\nrequest has been approved and it's in sync \/ up to date with latest master.\n\nWhen all the checks have passed, you should see something like this:\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/125088\/79736603-59e77f80-82fa-11ea-9e33-b5279a030e8b.png\"><img src=\"https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/125088\/79736603-59e77f80-82fa-11ea-9e33-b5279a030e8b.png\" width=\"450px\" \/><\/a>\n\nAfter the PR has been merged, you should wait for the ``benchmarks`` workflow to complete and then\ncheck our [CodeSpeed instance](https:\/\/scalyr-agent-codespeed.herokuapp.com\/) to ensure there are\nno regressions in terms of the resource utilization (memory and CPU usage) and things such as\nincreased number of error or warning log lines.\n\nHere is an example which demonstrates a regression in number of error level lines being printed to\nthe agent log which likely indicates a bug \/ regression in the code -\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/scalyr\/scalyr-agent-2\/pull\/513#issuecomment-617228472.\n\n### Monitor Plugins\n\nMonitor plugins are one of the key features for Scalyr Agent 2.  These plugins can be used to augment the\nfunctionality of Scalyr Agent 2 beyond just copying logs and metrics.  For example, there are monitor plugins\nthat will fetch page content at a given URL and then log portions of the returned content.  Another plugin allows\nyou to execute a shell command periodically and then log the output.  Essentially, plugs can be used to implement\nany periodic monitoring task you have.\n\nWe encourage users to create their own plugins to cover features they desire.  In the near future, we will be\npublishing documentation that describes how to implement your own monitor.  And, if you feel your monitor would\nbe useful to other Scalyr customers, we encourage you to submit it to monitor collection in the `monitors\/contrib`\ndirectory.\n\nTo learn how to develop plugins, please see the\n[instructions for creating a monitor plugin](docs\/CREATING_MONITORS.md).\n\n### Building Packages\n\nNOTE: Docker image build instructions now in the [BUILD.md](BUILD.md)\n\nYou can use the `build_packages.py` script to build your own RPM or Debian packages.  This is often desirable\nif your company has its own yum or apt repositories, or you have modified the Scalyr Agent 2 code to suit\nsome particular need.  (Of course, if you are finding you need to modify the Scalyr Agent 2 code, we encourage you\nto submit your changes back to the main repository).\n\nYou must have the following installed on your machine to create packages:\n\n  * fpm, see https:\/\/github.com\/jordansissel\/fpm\/\n  * rpmbuild (for building RPMs)\n  * gnutar \/ gtar (for building Debian packages)\n\nWe strongly suggest you use the same platform that you intend to install the agent on to build the packages.\nThis is because tools like `rpmbuild` and `gtar` are more available on the platforms that use those respective\npackaging systems.\n\nTo build the RPM package, execute the following command in the root directory of this repository\n\n    python build_package.py rpm\n\nTo build the Debian package, execute the following command in the root directory of this repository\n\n    python build_package.py deb\n\n### Pre-Commit Hooks\n\nThis project uses the [Black](http:\/\/black.readthedocs.io) code autoformatting tool with default\nsettings.\n\n[Pre-commit](https:\/\/pre-commit.com) is used to automatically run checks including Black formatting\nprior to a git commit.\n\nTo use pre-commit:\n\n- Use one of the [Installation Methods](https:\/\/pre-commit.com\/#install) from the documentation.\n- Install the hooks with `pre-commit install`.\n- To manually execute the pre-commit hooks (including black), run `pre-commit run --all-files` (\n  run it on all the files) or ``pre-commit run`` (run it only on staged files).\n\nAll the pre-commit targets rely on binaries from tox virtual environment so you need to make sure\ntox virtual environment for ``lint`` target exists:\n\n```bash\ntox -elint --notest --recreate\n```\n\n#### Pre-commit Configuration\n\n- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` configures the scripts run by pre-commit\n\nTo update the Pre-commit hooks , run `pre-commit autoupdate`. This will update\n`.pre-commit-config.yaml` and will need to be committed to the repository.\n\n## Contributing\n\nIn the future, we will be pushing guidelines on how to contribute to this repository.  For now, please just\nfeel free to submit pull requests to the `master` branch and we will work with you.\n\n## Copyright, License, and Contributors Agreement\n\nCopyright 2014-2021 Scalyr, Inc.

Alternatively, you may email\n[security@palletsprojects.com](mailto:security@palletsprojects.com), and we will\nconvert that to a GitHub security advisory.\n\nBe sure to include as much detail as necessary in your report. As with reporting\nnormal issues, a minimal reproducible example will help the maintainers address\nthe issue faster. Information about why the issue is a security issue is also\nhelpful. If you are able, you may also provide a fix for the issue.\n\nA maintainer will reply acknowledging the report and how to continue. We will\nobtain a CVE id as well, please do not do this on your own. We will work with\nyou to attempt to understand the issue and decide on its validity. Maintainers\nare volunteers working in their free time, and therefore cannot guarantee any\nspecific timeline. Please be patient during this process.\n\nThe current feature release will receive security fixes. Fixes to older versions\nmay be considered based on usage information and severity, but are not\nguaranteed.

All rights reserved.\n\nImpacket was originally created by [SecureAuth](https:\/\/www.secureauth.com\/labs\/open-source-tools\/impacket), and now maintained by Fortra's Core Security.\n\nImpacket is a collection of Python classes for working with network\nprotocols. Impacket is focused on providing low-level\nprogrammatic access to the packets and for some protocols (e.g.\nSMB1-3 and MSRPC) the protocol implementation itself.\nPackets can be constructed from scratch, as well as parsed from \nraw data, and the object-oriented API makes it simple to work with \ndeep hierarchies of protocols. The library provides a set of tools\nas examples of what can be done within the context of this library.\n\nWhat protocols are featured?\n----------------------------\n\n * Ethernet, Linux \"Cooked\" capture.\n * IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, IGMP, ARP.\n * IPv4 and IPv6 Support.\n * NMB and SMB1, SMB2 and SMB3 (high-level implementations).\n * MSRPC version 5, over different transports: TCP, SMB\/TCP, SMB\/NetBIOS and HTTP.\n * Plain, NTLM and Kerberos authentications, using password\/hashes\/tickets\/keys.\n * Portions\/full implementation of the following MSRPC interfaces: EPM, DTYPES, LSAD, LSAT, NRPC, RRP, SAMR, SRVS, WKST, SCMR, BKRP, DHCPM, EVEN6, MGMT, SASEC, TSCH, DCOM, WMI, OXABREF, NSPI, OXNSPI.\n * Portions of TDS (MSSQL) and LDAP protocol implementations.\n \nMaintainer\n==========\n\n[Core Security](https:\/\/www.coresecurity.com\/)\n\n\nTable of Contents\n=================\n\n* [Getting Impacket](#getting-impacket)\n* [Setup](#setup)\n* [Testing](#testing)\n* [Licensing](#licensing)\n* [Disclaimer](#disclaimer)\n* [Contact Us](#contact-us)\n\nGetting Impacket\n================\n\n### Latest version\n\n* Impacket v0.12.0\n\n  [![Python versions](https:\/\/img.shields.io\/pypi\/pyversions\/impacket.svg)](https:\/\/pypi.python.org\/pypi\/impacket\/)\n\n[Current and past releases](https:\/\/github.com\/fortra\/impacket\/releases)\n\n### Development version\n\n* Impacket v0.13.0-dev (**[master branch](https:\/\/github.com\/fortra\/impacket\/tree\/master)**)\n\n  [![Python versions](https:\/\/img.shields.io\/badge\/python-3.8%20|%203.9%20|%203.10%20|%203.11%20|%203.12-blue.svg)](https:\/\/github.com\/fortra\/impacket\/tree\/master)\n\n\nSetup\n=====\n\n### Quick start\n\n> :information_source: We recommend using `pipx` over `pip` for system-wide installations.\n\nIn order to grab the latest stable release run:\n\n    python3 -m pipx install impacket\n\nIf you want to play with the unreleased changes, download the development \nversion from the [master branch](https:\/\/github.com\/fortra\/impacket\/tree\/master),\nextract the package, and execute the following command from the\ndirectory where Impacket has been unpacked:\n\n    python3 -m pipx install .\n\n### Docker Support\n\nBuild Impacket's image:\n\n      $ docker build -t \"impacket:latest\" .\n\nUsing Impacket's image:\n\n      $ docker run -it --rm \"impacket:latest\"\n\nTesting\n=======\n\nThe library leverages the [pytest](https:\/\/docs.pytest.org\/) framework for organizing\nand marking test cases, [tox](https:\/\/tox.readthedocs.io\/) to automate the process of\nrunning them across supported Python versions, and [coverage](https:\/\/coverage.readthedocs.io\/)\nto obtain coverage statistics.\n\nA [comprehensive testing guide](TESTING.md) is available.\n\n\nLicensing\n=========\n\nThis software is provided under a slightly modified version of\nthe Apache Software License.

If your application depends on it there are examples of how to\nre-enable RSA1_5 usage in the tests files.\n\nNote: if you enable support for `RSA1_5` and the attacker can send you chosen\nciphertext and is able to measure the processing times of your application,\nthen your application will be vulnerable to a Bleichenbacher RSA padding\noracle, allowing the so-called \"Million messages attack\". That attack allows\nto decrypt intercepted messages (even if they were encrypted with RSA-OAEP) or\nforge signatures (both RSA-PKCS#1 v1.5 and RSASSA-PSS).\n\nGiven JWT is generally used in tokens to sign authorization assertions or to\nencrypt private key material, this is a particularly severe issue, and must\nnot be underestimated.\n",

If you find\nyourself jumping through hoops to allow your site administrators to do lots of\nthings, you're probably outside the use cases. Either trust those users, or\ndon't.\n\nBecause it relies on html5lib_, Bleach is as good as modern browsers at dealing\nwith weird, quirky HTML fragments. And *any* of Bleach's methods will fix\nunbalanced or mis-nested tags.\n\nThe version on GitHub_ is the most up-to-date and contains the latest bug\nfixes.

Please use\nthat if you're reporting a security issue.\n\nSecurity issues are fixed in private. After we land such a fix, we'll do a\nrelease.\n\nFor every release, we mark security issues we've fixed in the ``CHANGES`` in\nthe **Security issues** section.

                "body":"This was originally filed to the [security bug tracker](https:\/\/bugzilla.mozilla.org\/show_bug.cgi?id=1566541) but it was decided this is not within the security threat model of the library.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\nI decided to start work on a PR for the Bleach issue concerning localized domains (https:\/\/github.com\/mozilla\/bleach\/issues\/368). When building test-cases, I decided to generate one for \"punycode attacks\" aka [IDN Homograph Attack](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/IDN_homograph_attack) when unicode lookalike\/homoglyph characters are replaced in a link text.\r\n\r\nThis allows a malicious attacker to create a link to a lookalike domain name.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n    goog\u013ae.com\txn--googe-95a.com\r\n    wikipedi\u0430.org wikipedi\\u0430.org\r\n\r\n    print linkify(\"http:\/\/goog\u013ae.com\")\r\n    print linkify(\"http:\/\/wikipedi\u0430.org\")\r\n\r\nModern browsers defend against this somewhat by customizing what appears in the display bar once it is clicked; however they do not control (to my knowledge) what happens on the page.\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\n\r\n    print linkify(\"foo http:\/\/goog\u013ae.com bar\")\r\n    foo <a href=\"http:\/\/goog\u013ae.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/goog\u013ae.com<\/a> bar\r\n\r\n    print linkify(\"foo http:\/\/wikipedi\u0430.org bar\")\r\n    foo <a href=\"http:\/\/wikipedi\u0430.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/wikipedi\u0430.org<\/a> bar\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\n\r\nSince bleach is a security focused library, I think it should - be default - approach this situation how the strictest of modern browsers do, but allow for other use cases as this approach is very much tailored to \"English users\" and not the international community. I think a Boolean argument to linkify could be used to provide security by default, and allow non-english alphabet users the ability to opt-out.\r\n\r\nDefault: the HREF should be be the punycode version\r\n\r\n    <a href=\"http:\/\/xn--googe-95a.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/goog\u013ae.com<\/a>\r\n\r\nOptional Strict: Linkified Text is also punycode\r\n\r\n    <a href=\"http:\/\/xn--googe-95a.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/xn--googe-95a.com<\/a>\r\n\r\nOptional Loose: allow the text as-is and leave everything to the browser\r\n\r\n     <a href=\"http:\/\/goog\u013ae.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/goog\u013ae.com<\/a>\r\n\r\nThis functionality could also be implemented in a callback function, which would accept as input two arguments: the raw link and the context ('a' href value, 'a' node\/display text,  bare html to be turned into an a tag).\r\n\r\nHandling this via a callback is IMHO the best option as it would allow for bleach to abandon the regex of locked-down TLDs that seems to create more issues than it solves, while allowing users to still lock them down if wanted.",

Neither the thin nor standalone JAR depends on or embeds log4j, so\nyou can continue to use WireMock 2.32.0 and above without any risk of exposure to the recently discovered vulnerability.\n\n## Contributing\n\nWireMock exists and continues to thrive due to the efforts of contributors.\nRegardless of your expertise and time you could dedicate,\nthere're opportunities to participate and help the project!\n\nSee the [Contributing Guide](.\/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",

Our full documentation is available on `ipython.readthedocs.io\n<https:\/\/ipython.readthedocs.io\/en\/stable\/>`_ and contains information on how to install, use, and\ncontribute to the project.\nIPython (Interactive Python) is a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages, originally developed for the Python programming language, that offers introspection, rich media, shell syntax, tab completion, and history.\n\n**IPython versions and Python Support**\n\nStarting after IPython 8.16, we will progressively transition to `Spec-0000 <https:\/\/scientific-python.org\/specs\/spec-0000\/>`_.\n\nStarting with IPython 7.10, IPython follows `NEP 29 <https:\/\/numpy.org\/neps\/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html>`_\n\n**IPython 7.17+** requires Python version 3.7 and above.\n\n**IPython 7.10+** requires Python version 3.6 and above.\n\n**IPython 7.0** requires Python version 3.5 and above.\n\n**IPython 6.x** requires Python version 3.3 and above.\n\n**IPython 5.x LTS** is the compatible release for Python 2.7.\nIf you require Python 2 support, you **must** use IPython 5.x LTS. Please\nupdate your project configurations and requirements as necessary.\n\n\nThe Notebook, Qt console and a number of other pieces are now parts of *Jupyter*.\nSee the `Jupyter installation docs <https:\/\/jupyter.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/install.html>`__\nif you want to use these.\n\nMain features of IPython\n========================\nComprehensive object introspection.\n\nInput history, persistent across sessions.\n\nCaching of output results during a session with automatically generated references.\n\nExtensible tab completion, with support by default for completion of python variables and keywords, filenames and function keywords.\n\nExtensible system of \u2018magic\u2019 commands for controlling the environment and performing many tasks related to IPython or the operating system.\n\nA rich configuration system with easy switching between different setups (simpler than changing $PYTHONSTARTUP environment variables every time).\n\nSession logging and reloading.\n\nExtensible syntax processing for special purpose situations.\n\nAccess to the system shell with user-extensible alias system.\n\nEasily embeddable in other Python programs and GUIs.\n\nIntegrated access to the pdb debugger and the Python profiler.\n\n\nDevelopment and Instant running\n===============================\n\nYou can find the latest version of the development documentation on `readthedocs\n<https:\/\/ipython.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/>`_.\n\nYou can run IPython from this directory without even installing it system-wide\nby typing at the terminal::\n\n   $ python -m IPython\n\nOr see the `development installation docs\n<https:\/\/ipython.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/install\/install.html#installing-the-development-version>`_\nfor the latest revision on read the docs.\n\nDocumentation and installation instructions for older version of IPython can be\nfound on the `IPython website <https:\/\/ipython.org\/documentation.html>`_\n\n\nAlternatives to IPython\n=======================\n\nIPython may not be to your taste; if that's the case there might be similar\nproject that you might want to use:\n\n- The classic Python REPL.\n- `bpython <https:\/\/bpython-interpreter.org\/>`_\n- `mypython <https:\/\/www.asmeurer.com\/mypython\/>`_\n- `ptpython and ptipython <https:\/\/pypi.org\/project\/ptpython\/>`_\n- `Xonsh <https:\/\/xon.sh\/>`_\n\nIgnoring commits with git blame.ignoreRevsFile\n==============================================\n\nAs of git 2.23, it is possible to make formatting changes without breaking\n``git blame``. See the `git documentation\n<https:\/\/git-scm.com\/docs\/git-config#Documentation\/git-config.txt-blameignoreRevsFile>`_\nfor more details.\n\nTo use this feature you must:\n\n- Install git >= 2.23\n- Configure your local git repo by running:\n   - POSIX: ``tools\\configure-git-blame-ignore-revs.sh``\n   - Windows:  ``tools\\configure-git-blame-ignore-revs.bat``\n",

                "body":"Hi IPython,\r\n\r\nFirst off, I'd like to say how much I enjoy using IPython - I use it every day. Recently I've begun work on a [static analysis tool](https:\/\/github.com\/dlint-py\/dlint) for Python code. I ran a subset of its rules against the IPython code base and received some interesting results. In particular, Dlint's checks for `shell=True` subprocess calls:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ python3 -m flake8 --select=DUO116 ipython\/IPython\/\r\nipython\/IPython\/core\/interactiveshell.py:2482:22: DUO116 use of \"shell=True\" is insecure in \"subprocess\" module\r\nipython\/IPython\/core\/hooks.py:80:12: DUO116 use of \"shell=True\" is insecure in \"subprocess\" module\r\nipython\/IPython\/core\/page.py:214:24: DUO116 use of \"shell=True\" is insecure in \"subprocess\" module\r\nipython\/IPython\/lib\/editorhooks.py:55:16: DUO116 use of \"shell=True\" is insecure in \"subprocess\" module\r\nipython\/IPython\/utils\/_process_common.py:79:9: DUO116 use of \"shell=True\" is insecure in \"subprocess\" module\r\nipython\/IPython\/utils\/sysinfo.py:58:12: DUO116 use of \"shell=True\" is insecure in \"subprocess\" module\r\n```\r\n\r\nI manually investigated each finding with the following results:\r\n\r\n* `interactiveshell.py`: Unclear if vulnerable, unclear if `shell=True` is necessary\r\n* `hooks.py`: Vulnerable via `$EDITOR, shell=True` unnecessary\r\n* `page.py`: Vulnerable via `$PAGER`, `shell=True` unnecessary\r\n* `editorhooks.py`: Unclear if vulnerable, unclear if shell=True is necessary\r\n* `_process_commend.py`: Unclear if vulnerable, seems shell=True is necessary\r\n* `sysinfo.py`: Not vulnerable, `shell=True` unnecessary\r\n\r\nThe following demonstrates the vulnerabilities in hooks and page:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ PAGER='echo \"pager\" > \/tmp\/pager' ipython -c \"open??\"\r\n$ cat \/tmp\/pager\r\npager\r\n```\r\n```\r\n$ EDITOR='echo \"editor\" > \/tmp\/editor' ipython -c \"%edit\"\r\n$ cat \/tmp\/editor\r\neditor\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis issue is highlighted in the Python subprocess docs: [Subprocess Security Considerations](https:\/\/docs.python.org\/3\/library\/subprocess.html#security-considerations). This issue falls under CWE-77: [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')](https:\/\/cwe.mitre.org\/data\/definitions\/77.html). I would recommend avoiding `shell=True` whenever possible and investigating the other findings and ensuring they do not have the same issue. It appears that most of the calls do not need shell functionality anyway.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you need any additional information!",

                        "body":"Note: This conversation already happen on the security mailing list and is posted in public for transparency. \r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\n@Carreau replied\r\n\r\nHi Matt,\r\n\r\nMany thanks for the kind words, and thanks for the report, and for\r\npointing us to dlint..\r\n\r\nA few questions and discussion though.\r\nAs far as I understand,  \"Command injection\" usually refer to\r\napplication that are not meant to run arbitrary command. But do so\r\nunder adversarial user input.\r\n\r\n1) The goal of IPython **is** to run arbitrary commands; If you run\r\ncan run IPython, or enter commands into it you don't need to modify\r\n$PAGER or $EDITOR to execute arbitrary commands. I'm also unsure how\r\nan attacker would modify those env variable or provide adversarial\r\ninput.\r\n2) I believe the `shell=True` is necessary (at least ini `$EDITOR`) in\r\nboth the case you outline we do want to explicitly run arbitrary\r\ncommands. For example $EDITOR='atom -w' to have a blocking GUI editor\r\nafter calling `%edit`. `Shell=False` will say `no such command 'atom\r\n-w'` \u2013 I guess those can be handled by `shlex.split()`, but other like\r\nipython -c '%sx echo \"onpurpose\" > \/tmp\/onpurpose' really must use\r\nshell (sx stands for shell execute).\r\n\r\nSo I'd like to better understand what your threat model is, or would\r\nbe for such attacks.\r\nDoes \"Command injection\" really make sens when the goal of the project\r\nis arbitrary code  execution, or if I misunderstood some of the issues\r\nbehind command injections.\r\n\r\nI understand that some of the above would be cleaner w\/o shell=True,\r\nat least to show good practice.\r\n\r\nLet us know what you think, and wether there is a need to keep this\r\nprivate; in which case i'm open to have this public on the IPython\r\nrepo and\/or do a security advisory.\r\n\r\n---- \r\n\r\n@takluyver replied\r\n\r\n$PAGER can also include options, e.g. \"less -R\". So we can't easily switch away from shell=True there.\r\n\r\nThe threat model here would have to be an attacker that can set environment variables for a context where IPython will be used, but not give IPython commands directly or write anywhere on the filesystem (because if you can do that, you can point one of these environment variables to a script you've written, which gets run even with 'shell=False'). I imagine you can come up with some scenario like that, but given how IPython is designed to be used, I suspect those scenarios are pretty unlikely. If you figure out potential improvements in that area, I'd discuss them in the open rather than through the private security channels.\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\n@mschwager replied\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nThanks for the clarifications. Based on your inputs it seems that there isn't much that can be done. Though I'd say avoiding shell=True is still a good practice :)\r\n\r\nSince IPython is mostly a CLI\/development-focused tool, it's unlikely that it's used in such a way where these concerns are exploitable. However, there are probably places where it's being used in an unusual, hard to envision scenario. Further, the attacker would have to be somewhat constrained. As already mentioned, the attacker would have to be able to set env variables but not files on the filesystem. But even in this situation, defensive programming (such as shlex or no shell) wouldn't stop something like: EDITOR='python -c \"<arbitrary code>\"' ipython ...\r\n\r\nIf we consider some of the previously mentioned concerns:\r\nRequiring arguments to script, e.g. 'atom -w': we could avoid shell=True here by using shlex.split. Although this still falls into trouble with the arbitrary code example above.\r\nHandling shell execute functionality, e.g. '%sx': there's not much to be done here, this is the intended behavior :)\r\nThinking about shell=True a bit more... I believe this is most dangerous when user input is being concatenated with an existing string. For example, consider the following:\r\n\r\ncmd = 'ls -l {}'\r\ncmd = cmd.format(cmd, user_input_directory)\r\nsubprocess.Popen(cmd, shell=True)\r\n\r\nThe dangerous part here is that user input could be 'foo; rm -rf \/'. Adding shell=True enables multiple commands with ';'. Although the IPython codebase doesn't contain this behavior (or at least doesn't where code execution isn't intended).\r\n\r\nAll in all I'd say that there's no security issues here. Although I would say shlex instead of shell=True would generally be better practice.\r\n\r\nI appreciate all your feedback here and quick responses. I can use this to improve Dlint's analysis capabilities.\r\n\r\n",

Are there any other options that could be implemented? I'm sure that other people are interested in this as well especially now that Docker is a viable means provisioning per user notebooks.\n\n   What I am trying to do specifically is to add an HTTP Authorization header to each request that contains an authentication token, and have the handlers verify the validity of the token before servicing the request. Its easy to do and a common approach. I actually need access to the token for backend web service requests. I can override the front end HTML templates and have already modified the javascript to add the headers to the ajax requests, but I am blocked on the backend.\n\n   An alternative might be to setup configurable handlers for \/login and \/logout and have the front end register the authentication token with the login handler and receive a secure session cookie that references the . Code on the backend such as notebook handlers would have to have access to the session object to authenticate the user for access to data.\n\n   What do people think?\n   Steve\n",

Then the proxy would handle auth.\n\nAnyway, if you think specifically at one way to do that, I suggest for you to draft a proposal and\/or submit a pull request.\n\nI would also suggest looking at `DottedObjectName` configurable, that can allow to use custom class for some object in IPython.\n\nYou can probably have a look at [bookstore](https:\/\/github.com\/rgbkrk\/bookstore) a python package that allow to use rackspace as a storage backend. \n\nIt is a good example of how to use that with a 4 config line (extract from above link) : \n\n```\n# Setup IPython Notebook to write notebooks to CloudFiles\nc.NotebookApp.notebook_manager_class = 'bookstore.cloudfiles.CloudFilesNotebookManager'\n\n# Set your user name and API Key\nc.CloudFilesNotebookManager.account_name = USER_NAME\nc.CloudFilesNotebookManager.account_key = API_KEY\n\n# Container on CloudFiles\nc.CloudFilesNotebookManager.container_name = u'notebooks'\n```\n",

However if you look at how pluggable authentication is handled in other web platforms, you'll probably see that what I suggested is a fairly conventional approach to dealing with a reasonable number of use cases. I would rather not fork the IPython core and send a PR without a reasonable belief that it would be acceptable to the IPython core devs - so some reasonable guidance about what would be acceptable\/unacceptable in terms of design decisions would be helpful.\n\nAs far as having a front end proxy that instantiates new per user notebook instances, as you're no doubt aware, there's a bunch of people working on docker based solutions. We implemented a proof of concept with an nginx proxy + jiffylab, but I can't work on further it for a few weeks. I promised Paul Ivanov that I would upload the current duct tape and bailing wire prototype but haven't been able to scrape together the time for that yet. In the long term, my plan is to move most of the current jiffylab functionality into Nginx and enforce some level of authentication in the Nginx handlers - however that is a couple of months away, and will likely be using the Nginx embedded lua interpreter instead of python. It also doesn't solve the problem of making the authentication token available to a backend services like the notebook manager.\n\nThe example you posted uses a static username and password, so it doesn't support permissions based on user authentication. Thats really the problem, there needs to be a way to pass an authentication token from the web client through to the notebook manager and similar notebook server services, as well as a way to pass it through to the kernel - I implemented a monkeypatching solution for now on the notebook server and a parallel solution with frontend javascript calling into the kernel, but those are just hacks to get around the lack of support. I'll write up a strawman proposal to initiate discussion as you suggested, but it may take a couple of weeks until I'm past the current delivery crunch.\n\n   Steve\n",

If you are a company that is deeply\ncommitted to using open source technologies in artificial intelligence, machine, and deep learning, and want to support\nthe communities of open source projects in these domains, consider joining the LF AI & Data Foundation. For details\nabout who's involved and how Horovod plays a role, read the Linux Foundation `announcement <https:\/\/lfdl.io\/press\/2018\/12\/13\/lf-deep-learning-welcomes-horovod-distributed-training-framework-as-newest-project\/>`_.\n\n|\n\n.. contents::\n\n|\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\n- `Latest Release <https:\/\/horovod.readthedocs.io\/en\/stable>`_\n- `master <https:\/\/horovod.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest>`_\n\n|\n\nWhy Horovod?\n------------\nThe primary motivation for this project is to make it easy to take a single-GPU training script and successfully scale\nit to train across many GPUs in parallel. This has two aspects:\n\n1. How much modification does one have to make to a program to make it distributed, and how easy is it to run it?\n2. How much faster would it run in distributed mode?\n\nInternally at Uber we found the MPI model to be much more straightforward and require far less code changes than previous\nsolutions such as Distributed TensorFlow with parameter servers. Once a training script has been written for scale with\nHorovod, it can run on a single-GPU, multiple-GPUs, or even multiple hosts without any further code changes.\nSee the `Usage <#usage>`__ section for more details.\n\nIn addition to being easy to use, Horovod is fast. Below is a chart representing the benchmark that was done on 128\nservers with 4 Pascal GPUs each connected by RoCE-capable 25 Gbit\/s network:\n\n.. image:: https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/16640218\/38965607-bf5c46ca-4332-11e8-895a-b9c137e86013.png\n   :alt: 512-GPU Benchmark\n\nHorovod achieves 90% scaling efficiency for both Inception V3 and ResNet-101, and 68% scaling efficiency for VGG-16.\nSee `Benchmarks <docs\/benchmarks.rst>`_ to find out how to reproduce these numbers.\n\nWhile installing MPI and NCCL itself may seem like an extra hassle, it only needs to be done once by the team dealing\nwith infrastructure, while everyone else in the company who builds the models can enjoy the simplicity of training them at\nscale.\n\n\nInstall\n-------\nTo install Horovod on Linux or macOS:\n\n1. Install `CMake <https:\/\/cmake.org\/install\/>`__\n\n.. raw:: html\n\n    <p\/>\n\n2. If you've installed TensorFlow from `PyPI <https:\/\/pypi.org\/project\/tensorflow>`__, make sure that ``g++-5`` or above is installed.\n   Starting with TensorFlow 2.10 a C++17-compliant compiler like ``g++8`` or above will be required.\n\n   If you've installed PyTorch from `PyPI <https:\/\/pypi.org\/project\/torch>`__, make sure that ``g++-5`` or above is installed.\n\n   If you've installed either package from `Conda <https:\/\/conda.io>`_, make sure that the ``gxx_linux-64`` Conda package is installed.\n\n.. raw:: html\n\n    <p\/>\n\n3. Install the ``horovod`` pip package.\n\n   To run on CPUs:\n\n   .. code-block:: bash\n\n      $ pip install horovod\n\n   To run on GPUs with NCCL:\n\n   .. code-block:: bash\n\n      $ HOROVOD_GPU_OPERATIONS=NCCL pip install horovod\n\nFor more details on installing Horovod with GPU support, read `Horovod on GPU <docs\/gpus.rst>`_.\n\nFor the full list of Horovod installation options, read the `Installation Guide <docs\/install.rst>`_.\n\nIf you want to use MPI, read `Horovod with MPI <docs\/mpi.rst>`_.\n\nIf you want to use Conda, read `Building a Conda environment with GPU support for Horovod <docs\/conda.rst>`_.\n\nIf you want to use Docker, read `Horovod in Docker <docs\/docker.rst>`_.\n\nTo compile Horovod from source, follow the instructions in the `Contributor Guide <docs\/contributors.rst>`_.\n\n\nConcepts\n--------\nHorovod core principles are based on `MPI <http:\/\/mpi-forum.org\/>`_ concepts such as *size*, *rank*,\n*local rank*, **allreduce**, **allgather**, **broadcast**, and **alltoall**. See `this page <docs\/concepts.rst>`_\nfor more details.\n\nSupported frameworks\n--------------------\nSee these pages for Horovod examples and best practices:\n\n- `Horovod with TensorFlow <docs\/tensorflow.rst>`_\n- `Horovod with XLA in Tensorflow <xla.rst>`_\n- `Horovod with Keras <docs\/keras.rst>`_\n- `Horovod with PyTorch <docs\/pytorch.rst>`_\n- `Horovod with MXNet <docs\/mxnet.rst>`_\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nTo use Horovod, make the following additions to your program:\n\n1. Run ``hvd.init()`` to initialize Horovod.\n\n.. raw:: html\n\n    <p\/>\n\n2. Pin each GPU to a single process to avoid resource contention.\n\n   With the typical setup of one GPU per process, set this to *local rank*. The first process on\n   the server will be allocated the first GPU, the second process will be allocated the second GPU, and so forth.\n\n.. raw:: html\n\n    <p\/>\n\n\n3. Scale the learning rate by the number of workers.\n\n   Effective batch size in synchronous distributed training is scaled by the number of workers.\n   An increase in learning rate compensates for the increased batch size.\n\n.. raw:: html\n\n    <p\/>\n\n\n4. Wrap the optimizer in ``hvd.DistributedOptimizer``.\n\n   The distributed optimizer delegates gradient computation to the original optimizer, averages gradients using **allreduce** or **allgather**, and then applies those averaged gradients.\n\n.. raw:: html\n\n    <p\/>\n\n\n5. Broadcast the initial variable states from rank 0 to all other processes.\n\n   This is necessary to ensure consistent initialization of all workers when training is started with random weights or restored from a checkpoint.\n\n.. raw:: html\n\n    <p\/>\n\n\n6. Modify your code to save checkpoints only on worker 0 to prevent other workers from corrupting them.\n\n.. raw:: html\n\n    <p\/>\n\n\nExample using TensorFlow v1 (see the `examples <https:\/\/github.com\/horovod\/horovod\/blob\/master\/examples\/>`_ directory for full training examples):\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import tensorflow as tf\n    import horovod.tensorflow as hvd\n\n\n    # Initialize Horovod\n    hvd.init()\n\n    # Pin GPU to be used to process local rank (one GPU per process)\n    config = tf.ConfigProto()\n    config.gpu_options.visible_device_list = str(hvd.local_rank())\n\n    # Build model...\n    loss = ...\n    opt = tf.train.AdagradOptimizer(0.01 * hvd.size())\n\n    # Add Horovod Distributed Optimizer\n    opt = hvd.DistributedOptimizer(opt)\n\n    # Add hook to broadcast variables from rank 0 to all other processes during\n    # initialization.\n    hooks = [hvd.BroadcastGlobalVariablesHook(0)]\n\n    # Make training operation\n    train_op = opt.minimize(loss)\n\n    # Save checkpoints only on worker 0 to prevent other workers from corrupting them.\n    checkpoint_dir = '\/tmp\/train_logs' if hvd.rank() == 0 else None\n\n    # The MonitoredTrainingSession takes care of session initialization,\n    # restoring from a checkpoint, saving to a checkpoint, and closing when done\n    # or an error occurs.\n    with tf.train.MonitoredTrainingSession(checkpoint_dir=checkpoint_dir,\n                                           config=config,\n                                           hooks=hooks) as mon_sess:\n      while not mon_sess.should_stop():\n        # Perform synchronous training.\n        mon_sess.run(train_op)\n\n\nRunning Horovod\n---------------\nThe example commands below show how to run distributed training.\nSee `Run Horovod <docs\/running.rst>`_ for more details, including RoCE\/InfiniBand tweaks and tips for dealing with hangs.\n\n1. To run on a machine with 4 GPUs:\n\n   .. code-block:: bash\n\n        $ horovodrun -np 4 -H localhost:4 python train.py\n\n2. To run on 4 machines with 4 GPUs each:\n\n   .. code-block:: bash\n\n       $ horovodrun -np 16 -H server1:4,server2:4,server3:4,server4:4 python train.py\n\n3.

To run on Hadoop Yarn, see `TonY <https:\/\/github.com\/linkedin\/TonY\/>`_.\n\nGloo\n----\n`Gloo <https:\/\/github.com\/facebookincubator\/gloo>`_ is an open source collective communications library developed by Facebook.\n\nGloo comes included with Horovod, and allows users to run Horovod without requiring MPI to be installed.\n\nFor environments that have support both MPI and Gloo, you can choose to use Gloo at runtime by passing the ``--gloo`` argument to ``horovodrun``:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n     $ horovodrun --gloo -np 2 python train.py\n\nmpi4py\n------\nHorovod supports mixing and matching Horovod collectives with other MPI libraries, such as `mpi4py <https:\/\/mpi4py.scipy.org>`_,\nprovided that the MPI was built with multi-threading support.\n\nYou can check for MPI multi-threading support by querying the ``hvd.mpi_threads_supported()`` function.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import horovod.tensorflow as hvd\n\n    # Initialize Horovod\n    hvd.init()\n\n    # Verify that MPI multi-threading is supported.\n    assert hvd.mpi_threads_supported()\n\n    from mpi4py import MPI\n    assert hvd.size() == MPI.COMM_WORLD.Get_size()\n\nYou can also initialize Horovod with an `mpi4py` sub-communicator, in which case each sub-communicator\nwill run an independent Horovod training.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from mpi4py import MPI\n    import horovod.tensorflow as hvd\n\n    # Split COMM_WORLD into subcommunicators\n    subcomm = MPI.COMM_WORLD.Split(color=MPI.COMM_WORLD.rank % 2,\n                                   key=MPI.COMM_WORLD.rank)\n\n    # Initialize Horovod\n    hvd.init(comm=subcomm)\n\n    print('COMM_WORLD rank: %d, Horovod rank: %d' % (MPI.COMM_WORLD.rank, hvd.rank()))\n\n\nInference\n---------\nLearn how to optimize your model for inference and remove Horovod operations from the graph `here <docs\/inference.rst>`_.\n\n\nTensor Fusion\n-------------\nOne of the unique things about Horovod is its ability to interleave communication and computation coupled with the ability\nto batch small **allreduce** operations, which results in improved performance. We call this batching feature Tensor Fusion.\n\nSee `here <docs\/tensor-fusion.rst>`__ for full details and tweaking instructions.\n\n\nHorovod Timeline\n----------------\nHorovod has the ability to record the timeline of its activity, called Horovod Timeline.\n\n.. image:: https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/16640218\/29735271-9e148da0-89ac-11e7-9ae0-11d7a099ac89.png\n   :alt: Horovod Timeline\n\nUse Horovod timeline to analyze Horovod performance.\nSee `here <docs\/timeline.rst>`__ for full details and usage instructions.\n\n\nAutomated Performance Tuning\n----------------------------\nSelecting the right values to efficiently make use of Tensor Fusion and other advanced Horovod features can involve\na good amount of trial and error. We provide a system to automate this performance optimization process called\n**autotuning**, which you can enable with a single command line argument to ``horovodrun``.\n\nSee `here <docs\/autotune.rst>`__ for full details and usage instructions.\n\n\nHorovod Process Sets\n--------------------\nHorovod allows you to concurrently run distinct collective operations in different groups of processes taking part in\none distributed training. Set up ``hvd.process_set`` objects to make use of this capability.\n\nSee `Process Sets <docs\/process_set.rst>`__ for detailed instructions.\n\n\nGuides\n------\n1.

        "SecurityPolicy_content":"=======================\nSecurity considerations\n=======================\n\nTransmission security\n=====================\n\nUse https for the web interface as well as for the update client (if possible).\n\nOtherwise, your username \/ password (FQDN \/ update secret) will be transmitted\nin clear text (unencrypted).\n\nThe web interface will warn you if you use it via http. If WE_HAVE_TLS is\nset to True, it will suggest you better use the https site and link there.\n\nAdditionally, the service administrator can implement a redirect from the\nhttp to the https site within the webserver configuration for the WWW_HOST.\nThe redirect should **not** be implemented for WWW_IPV4_HOST and WWW_IPV6_HOST\nas it is unknown whether all update clients can deal with a redirect (and\nsupport TLS).\n\nFor the router \/ update client configuration examples we show when creating a\nupdate secret, we use update URLs with https: (and we also tell why it might\nnot work).\n\nOn the hosts overview page, we show whether we received the last update via TLS.\n\nPlease note that if you like security, you also need to use https (with\ncertificate verification) if you use the web-based method to query your IP\naddress. If you use http, a powerful attacker could MITM your request and\ntell you a wrong IP, which your updater then would happily write into DNS.\n\n\nLogin with remote vs. local Account\n===================================\n\nIf you use a already existing remote account to log in into our service, you\ndon't need to create a local profile (with username, E-Mail and password).\n\nThat way, we need to store less information about you - especially no password\nhash (and you also don't need to create a new password just for our service).\nSo, this is a little more safe if you just consider our service.\n\nBUT: If you use some external service to log in, you of course need to trust\nthem for this purpose as *they* are telling \"yes, this is really you\".\n\nAlso, if you cancel the account on that external service and you don't have\na local profile (login, E-Mail, password) with us, you will be unable to log\nin afterwards or recover access to your hosts\/domains.\n\nSo maybe the best way is to first create a local profile (username, E-Mail,\npassword), then log in and associate your other remote accounts with that\nlocal profile.\n\n\nPasswords \/ Secrets \/ Keys\n==========================\n\nInteractive login password\n--------------------------\n\nWe recommend that you use a rather strong and not guessable password for this.\nDo not re-use passwords, use a password system or a password manager.\n\nThe interactive login password for the web site is stored using Django's\ndefault hasher mechanism, which is currently pbkdf2 (a very strong and\nintentionally slow password hash). Brute-Force attacks against such hashes are\nvery slow, much slower than against simple hashes like (s)sha1\/sha256 etc.\n\nIt is NOT stored in clear text by nsupdate.info.\n\nIf you lose the password, you'll have to do a password reset via e-mail.\n\n\nAutomated update secret\n-----------------------\n\nThe automated update secret for routers or other update clients is a\nrandom and automatically generated secret. We store it using the sha1 hasher\nof Django (which in fact is salted-sha1, a not very strong, but fast-to-compute\nhash).\n\nConsidering that a lot of routers or update clients store this secret in clear\ntext in their configuration and often transmit it using unencrypted http (and\nnot https), this secret is not too safe anyway. We also wanted to save some cpu\ncycles here and rather not use pbkdf2 for this regularly and automatically used\nsecret.\n\nIt is not stored in clear text by nsupdate.info.\n\nIf you lose the secret, you'll have to generate a new one and change it in your\nupdate client also.\n\nWe use a random and automatically generated update secret to avoid that users\nenter a bad password here (like reusing a password they use somewhere else,\nchoosing a too simple password) and to avoid disclosure of such user-chosen\npasswords in case the hashes ever get stolen and brute forced.\n\n\nNameserver Update Secret (backend, RFC 2136)\n--------------------------------------------\n\nWe currently store this secret (which is basically a base64 encoded shared secret,\none per dynamic zone) \"as is\" into the database (\"Domain\" records there).\n\nThis is somehow critical, but also hard to do better - encryption would only\nhelp very little here as we would need to decrypt the update secret before using it,\nso we would need the unlocked decryption key on the same machine.\n\nMake sure no unauthorized person gets that secret or he\/she will be able to update\nANY record in the respective zone \/ nameserver directly (without going over\nnsupdate.info software \/ service).\n\nWe support creating a random update secret, so you don't need an extra tool for this.\n\n\nOther Services Update Secret (dyndns2 client)\n---------------------------------------------\n\nWe need to store this secret \"as is\" into the database for the same reasons as\noutlined above.\n\nBut: we tell you in the services overview whether we'll use TLS to transmit the\nupdate, so at least if TLS is enabled, it won't go unencrypted over the wire.\n\n\nCSRF protection\n===============\n\nWe use Django's CSRF protection middleware.\n\n\nClickjacking protection\n=======================\n\nWe use Django's clickjacking protection middleware.\n\n\nXSS protection\n==============\n\nDjango's templating engine html-escapes inputs by default.\n\n\nCookies\n=======\n\nThe software (\"as is\") uses these cookies:\n\n* \"csrftoken\" (host-only, for CSRF protection)\n* \"sessionid\" (host-only, to keep the session when you have logged-in to the\n  web interface)\n\nIf you have set WE_HAVE_TLS to True (because you run the software on a https\nsite), you should also set *_COOKIE_SECURE to True to avoid the cookies getting\ntransmitted via http.\n\nWe use a session cookie by default (gets cleared when you close the browser).\nIf you check the \"Keep me logged in\" checkbox on the login screen, then we'll\nset a permanent cookie with a lifetime as configured by the site admin\n(SESSION_COOKIE_AGE, default: 14 days).\n\nBe careful with domain cookies\n------------------------------\n\nThe software (\"as is\") does not use any domain cookies.\n\nIn case you modify the software, please be extremely cautious with domain\ncookies and in case of doubt, do rather not use them.\n\nIf you use domain cookies (like for \".yourservice.net\", the leading dot\nmakes it a domain cookie), all hosts in that domain would be able to read\nand write these cookies. Your site (at e.g. www.yourservice.net), but also\nusers' sites (like attacker.yourservice.net).\n\nObviously, this might lead to security issues with stealing, modifying and\nfaking domain cookies.\n\n\nDjango's SECRET_KEY\n===================\n\nDjango's SECRET_KEY needs to be a long, random and secret string (it is\nusually set up by the administrator of the site).\n\nThe builtin default settings will try to read SECRET_KEY from an environment\nvariable of same name. If there is no such environment variable, the SECRET_KEY\nwill be undefined.\n\nYou can also define the SECRET_KEY in your local_settings.py.\n\nIf you do not define a SECRET_KEY by one of these methods, the application\nwill refuse to start and give you an error, that a SECRET_KEY is required.\n",

The only critical thing is that your domain provider is willing to add the DS records to the top level domain.\n\nFor my zone I have the following config for DNSSEC with nsupdate:\n\n```\nzone \"stratum0.net\" {\n        auto-dnssec maintain;\n        type master;\n        update-policy {\n                  ....\n        };\n        file \"\/etc\/bind\/stratum0.net\/stratum0.net\";\n        key-directory \"\/etc\/bind\/stratum0.net\";\n};\n```\n\nOnly auto-dnssec maintain and key-directory \"\/etc\/bind\/stratum0.net\" are relevant to DNSSEC. With this setup, you only need to use dnssec-keygen to generate the KSK and ZSK. Finally you generate the DS records with dnssec-dsfromkey -f <zonefile> and pass those to your domain provider. There is a short guide at http:\/\/fanf.livejournal.com\/112476.html.\n\nIf your domain provider doesn't support DNSSEC, you can use [DLV (DNSSEC Look-aside Validation)](https:\/\/dlv.isc.org\/). It's an alternative entry point and also very useful for initial testing.\n\nAlso very useful for debugging is http:\/\/dnsviz.net\/d\/stratum0.net\/dnssec\/, which shows you a graph of all keys and their relationships. The gray DNSKEYs are KSKs and the while ones are ZSKs. To keep DNS messages smaller, DNSSEC uses shorter keys and so they must be rotated regularly. The longer (2048 bit) KSKs have a lifetime on the order of years and the shorter (1024 bit) ZSKs on the order of months. Note that they do not expire after this time, it's just strongly recommended to perform a rollover after that time.\n\nWith auto-dnssec maintain, you just have to generate new keys. The metadata in the key files allows BIND to handle the rollover automatically. For KSK changes, you'd need to notify your domain provider again.\n\nThis setup has been running without problems for since two months on stratum0.net (which provides DYNDNS for our hackerspace).\n",

The only critical thing is that your domain provider is willing to add the DS records to the top level domain.\n\nFor my zone I have the following config for DNSSEC with nsupdate:\n\n```\nzone \"stratum0.net\" {\n        auto-dnssec maintain;\n        type master;\n        update-policy {\n                  ....\n        };\n        file \"\/etc\/bind\/stratum0.net\/stratum0.net\";\n        key-directory \"\/etc\/bind\/stratum0.net\";\n};\n```\n\nOnly auto-dnssec maintain and key-directory \"\/etc\/bind\/stratum0.net\" are relevant to DNSSEC. With this setup, you only need to use dnssec-keygen to generate the KSK and ZSK. Finally you generate the DS records with dnssec-dsfromkey -f <zonefile> and pass those to your domain provider. There is a short guide at http:\/\/fanf.livejournal.com\/112476.html.\n\nIf your domain provider doesn't support DNSSEC, you can use [DLV (DNSSEC Look-aside Validation)](https:\/\/dlv.isc.org\/). It's an alternative entry point and also very useful for initial testing.\n\nAlso very useful for debugging is http:\/\/dnsviz.net\/d\/stratum0.net\/dnssec\/, which shows you a graph of all keys and their relationships. The gray DNSKEYs are KSKs and the while ones are ZSKs. To keep DNS messages smaller, DNSSEC uses shorter keys and so they must be rotated regularly. The longer (2048 bit) KSKs have a lifetime on the order of years and the shorter (1024 bit) ZSKs on the order of months. Note that they do not expire after this time, it's just strongly recommended to perform a rollover after that time.\n\nWith auto-dnssec maintain, you just have to generate new keys. The metadata in the key files allows BIND to handle the rollover automatically. For KSK changes, you'd need to notify your domain provider again.\n\nThis setup has been running without problems for since two months on stratum0.net (which provides DYNDNS for our hackerspace).\n",

Check out [LangChain.js](https:\/\/github.com\/langchain-ai\/langchainjs).\n\nTo help you ship LangChain apps to production faster, check out [LangSmith](https:\/\/smith.langchain.com).\n[LangSmith](https:\/\/smith.langchain.com) is a unified developer platform for building, testing, and monitoring LLM applications.\nFill out [this form](https:\/\/www.langchain.com\/contact-sales) to speak with our sales team.\n\n## Quick Install\n\nWith pip:\n\n```bash\npip install langchain\n```\n\nWith conda:\n\n```bash\nconda install langchain -c conda-forge\n```\n\n## \ud83e\udd14 What is LangChain?\n\n**LangChain** is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs).\n\nFor these applications, LangChain simplifies the entire application lifecycle:\n\n- **Open-source libraries**: Build your applications using LangChain's open-source [building blocks](https:\/\/python.langchain.com\/docs\/concepts\/#langchain-expression-language-lcel), [components](https:\/\/python.langchain.com\/docs\/concepts\/), and [third-party integrations](https:\/\/python.langchain.com\/docs\/integrations\/providers\/).\n  Use [LangGraph](https:\/\/langchain-ai.github.io\/langgraph\/) to build stateful agents with first-class streaming and human-in-the-loop support.\n- **Productionization**: Inspect, monitor, and evaluate your apps with [LangSmith](https:\/\/docs.smith.langchain.com\/) so that you can constantly optimize and deploy with confidence.\n- **Deployment**: Turn your LangGraph applications into production-ready APIs and Assistants with [LangGraph Cloud](https:\/\/langchain-ai.github.io\/langgraph\/cloud\/).\n\n### Open-source libraries\n\n- **`langchain-core`**: Base abstractions and LangChain Expression Language.\n- **`langchain-community`**: Third party integrations.\n  - Some integrations have been further split into **partner packages** that only rely on **`langchain-core`**. Examples include **`langchain_openai`** and **`langchain_anthropic`**.\n- **`langchain`**: Chains, agents, and retrieval strategies that make up an application's cognitive architecture.\n- **[`LangGraph`](https:\/\/langchain-ai.github.io\/langgraph\/)**: A library for building robust and stateful multi-actor applications with LLMs by modeling steps as edges and nodes in a graph. Integrates smoothly with LangChain, but can be used without it. To learn more about LangGraph, check out our first LangChain Academy course, *Introduction to LangGraph*, available [here](https:\/\/academy.langchain.com\/courses\/intro-to-langgraph).\n\n### Productionization:\n\n- **[LangSmith](https:\/\/docs.smith.langchain.com\/)**: A developer platform that lets you debug, test, evaluate, and monitor chains built on any LLM framework and seamlessly integrates with LangChain.\n\n### Deployment:\n\n- **[LangGraph Cloud](https:\/\/langchain-ai.github.io\/langgraph\/cloud\/)**: Turn your LangGraph applications into production-ready APIs and Assistants.\n\n![Diagram outlining the hierarchical organization of the LangChain framework, displaying the interconnected parts across multiple layers.](docs\/static\/svg\/langchain_stack_062024.svg \"LangChain Architecture Overview\")\n\n## \ud83e\uddf1 What can you build with LangChain?\n\n**\u2753 Question answering with RAG**\n\n- [Documentation](https:\/\/python.langchain.com\/docs\/tutorials\/rag\/)\n- End-to-end Example: [Chat LangChain](https:\/\/chat.langchain.com) and [repo](https:\/\/github.com\/langchain-ai\/chat-langchain)\n\n**\ud83e\uddf1 Extracting structured output**\n\n- [Documentation](https:\/\/python.langchain.com\/docs\/tutorials\/extraction\/)\n- End-to-end Example: [SQL Llama2 Template](https:\/\/github.com\/langchain-ai\/langchain-extract\/)\n\n**\ud83e\udd16 Chatbots**\n\n- [Documentation](https:\/\/python.langchain.com\/docs\/tutorials\/chatbot\/)\n- End-to-end Example: [Web LangChain (web researcher chatbot)](https:\/\/weblangchain.vercel.app) and [repo](https:\/\/github.com\/langchain-ai\/weblangchain)\n\nAnd much more! Head to the [Tutorials](https:\/\/python.langchain.com\/docs\/tutorials\/) section of the docs for more.\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 How does LangChain help?\n\nThe main value props of the LangChain libraries are:\n\n1. **Components**: composable building blocks, tools and integrations for working with language models. Components are modular and easy-to-use, whether you are using the rest of the LangChain framework or not\n2. **Off-the-shelf chains**: built-in assemblages of components for accomplishing higher-level tasks\n\nOff-the-shelf chains make it easy to get started. Components make it easy to customize existing chains and build new ones.\n\n## LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)\n\nLCEL is a key part of LangChain, allowing you to build and organize chains of processes in a straightforward, declarative manner. It was designed to support taking prototypes directly into production without needing to alter any code. This means you can use LCEL to set up everything from basic \"prompt + LLM\" setups to intricate, multi-step workflows.\n\n- **[Overview](https:\/\/python.langchain.com\/docs\/concepts\/#langchain-expression-language-lcel)**: LCEL and its benefits\n- **[Interface](https:\/\/python.langchain.com\/docs\/concepts\/#runnable-interface)**: The standard Runnable interface for LCEL objects\n- **[Primitives](https:\/\/python.langchain.com\/docs\/how_to\/#langchain-expression-language-lcel)**: More on the primitives LCEL includes\n- **[Cheatsheet](https:\/\/python.langchain.com\/docs\/how_to\/lcel_cheatsheet\/)**: Quick overview of the most common usage patterns\n\n## Components\n\nComponents fall into the following **modules**:\n\n**\ud83d\udcc3 Model I\/O**\n\nThis includes [prompt management](https:\/\/python.langchain.com\/docs\/concepts\/#prompt-templates), [prompt optimization](https:\/\/python.langchain.com\/docs\/concepts\/#example-selectors), a generic interface for [chat models](https:\/\/python.langchain.com\/docs\/concepts\/#chat-models) and [LLMs](https:\/\/python.langchain.com\/docs\/concepts\/#llms), and common utilities for working with [model outputs](https:\/\/python.langchain.com\/docs\/concepts\/#output-parsers).\n\n**\ud83d\udcda Retrieval**\n\nRetrieval Augmented Generation involves [loading data](https:\/\/python.langchain.com\/docs\/concepts\/#document-loaders) from a variety of sources, [preparing it](https:\/\/python.langchain.com\/docs\/concepts\/#text-splitters), then [searching over (a.k.a. retrieving from)](https:\/\/python.langchain.com\/docs\/concepts\/#retrievers) it for use in the generation step.\n\n**\ud83e\udd16 Agents**\n\nAgents allow an LLM autonomy over how a task is accomplished. Agents make decisions about which Actions to take, then take that Action, observe the result, and repeat until the task is complete. LangChain provides a [standard interface for agents](https:\/\/python.langchain.com\/docs\/concepts\/#agents), along with [LangGraph](https:\/\/github.com\/langchain-ai\/langgraph) for building custom agents.\n\n## \ud83d\udcd6 Documentation\n\nPlease see [here](https:\/\/python.langchain.com) for full documentation, which includes:\n\n- [Introduction](https:\/\/python.langchain.com\/docs\/introduction\/): Overview of the framework and the structure of the docs.\n- [Tutorials](https:\/\/python.langchain.com\/docs\/tutorials\/): If you're looking to build something specific or are more of a hands-on learner, check out our tutorials.

Can I apply for a CVE for this issue?\r\n\r\n### System Info\r\n\r\nlangchain==0.1.16\r\nlangchain-anthropic==0.1.4\r\nlangchain-community==0.0.34\r\nlangchain-core==0.1.46\r\nlangchain-groq==0.1.3\r\nlangchain-openai==0.1.1\r\nlangchain-text-splitters==0.0.1\r\n",

                        "body":"_\ud83e\udd16_\n<!-- Greeting -->\nHello @Vegoo89,\n\nI'm [Dosu](https:\/\/dosu.dev), an automated assistant here to help you with your issues, answer questions, and guide you in becoming a contributor while we wait for a human maintainer. I'm here to make your experience with LangChain as smooth as possible. Let's get started with your issue!\n\n<!-- Answer -->\nThank you for bringing this to our attention. The `PythonREPL` component, which currently exists in the base library, can indeed be moved exclusively to the `experimental` version of `langchain` to address security concerns. This can be done by moving the entire `PythonREPL` class definition to the appropriate file in the `experimental` version of the library.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. Cut the entire `PythonREPL` class from the `libs\/langchain\/langchain\/utilities\/python.py` file.\n\n```py\nclass PythonREPL(BaseModel):\n    \"\"\"Simulates a standalone Python REPL.\"\"\"\n\n    globals: Optional[Dict] = Field(default_factory=dict, alias=\"_globals\")\n    locals: Optional[Dict] = Field(default_factory=dict, alias=\"_locals\")\n\n    @classmethod\n    def worker(\n        cls,\n        command: str,\n        globals: Optional[Dict],\n        locals: Optional[Dict],\n        queue: multiprocessing.Queue,\n    ) -> None:\n        old_stdout = sys.stdout\n        sys.stdout = mystdout = StringIO()\n        try:\n            exec(command, globals, locals)\n            sys.stdout = old_stdout\n            queue.put(mystdout.getvalue())\n        except Exception as e:\n            sys.stdout = old_stdout\n            queue.put(repr(e))\n\n    def run(self, command: str, timeout: Optional[int] = None) -> str:\n        \"\"\"Run command with own globals\/locals and returns anything printed.\n        Timeout after the specified number of seconds.\"\"\"\n\n        # Warn against dangers of PythonREPL\n        warn_once()\n\n        queue: multiprocessing.Queue = multiprocessing.Queue()\n\n        # Only use multiprocessing if we are enforcing a timeout\n        if timeout is not None:\n            # create a Process\n            p = multiprocessing.Process(\n                target=self.worker, args=(command, self.globals, self.locals, queue)\n            )\n\n            # start it\n            p.start()\n\n            # wait for the process to finish or kill it after timeout seconds\n            p.join(timeout)\n\n            if p.is_alive():\n                p.terminate()\n                return \"Execution timed out\"\n        else:\n            self.worker(command, self.globals, self.locals, queue)\n        # get the result from the worker function\n        return queue.get()\n```\n\n2. Paste the `PythonREPL` class into the appropriate file in the `experimental` version of the library.\n\nRemember to also move any dependencies that `PythonREPL` has, such as the `warn_once` function and any imported modules, to ensure that the class continues to function correctly.\n\nThis issue has been addressed before in the LangChain repository. You can refer to the following issues and pull requests for more information:\n\n- [Issue: what string works for experimental tool](https:\/\/github.com\/langchain-ai\/langchain\/issues\/13856)\n- [Remove `python_repl` from _BASE_TOOLS](https:\/\/github.com\/langchain-ai\/langchain\/pull\/13962)\n- [Remove `python_repl` from _BASE_TOOLS (#13962)](https:\/\/github.com\/Nghiauet\/langchain\/commit\/5ccdf94985f8fd6c16aa7b65e2708415cbf175c7)\n\nPlease let me know if you need further assistance.\n\n## Sources\n- [Issue: what string works for experimental tool](https:\/\/github.com\/langchain-ai\/langchain\/issues\/13856)\n- [libs\/langchain\/langchain\/utilities\/python.py](https:\/\/github.com\/langchain-ai\/langchain\/blob\/master\/libs\/langchain\/langchain\/utilities\/python.py)\n\n---\n\nThis response is meant to be useful and save you time.

This is due to the fact that `numexpr.evaluate` uses Python's `eval` function, which can execute arbitrary Python code.\n\nHere's the code snippet in question:\n\n```py\ndef _evaluate_expression(self, expression: str) -> str:\n    try:\n        local_dict = {\"pi\": math.pi, \"e\": math.e}\n        output = str(\n            numexpr.evaluate(\n                expression.strip(),\n                global_dict={},  # restrict access to globals\n                local_dict=local_dict,  # add common mathematical functions\n            )\n        )\n    except Exception as e:\n        raise ValueError(\n            f'LLMMathChain._evaluate(\"{expression}\") raised error: {e}.'\n            \" Please try again with a valid numerical expression\"\n        )\n\n    # Remove any leading and trailing brackets from the output\n    return re.sub(r\"^\\[|\\]$\", \"\", output)\n```\n\nIn this code, `numexpr.evaluate` is called with the `expression` argument, which could potentially contain malicious code. Although the `global_dict` argument is set to an empty dictionary to restrict access to global variables, and the `local_dict` argument is set to a dictionary containing common mathematical functions, this does not prevent the execution of arbitrary code.\n\nThis means that a malicious user could potentially execute arbitrary code on the server where LangChain is running by passing a specially crafted expression to the `LLMMathChain`'s `run` method. This is indeed a serious security issue that needs to be addressed.\n\nHowever, please note that this is just one potential interpretation of the issue. If you believe this interpretation is correct and that this is a bug that could impact other users, I encourage you to make a pull request to address this issue. If your experience contradicts this interpretation, I would suggest upgrading to the latest version of LangChain to see if the issue persists.\n\n## Sources\n- [libs\/langchain\/langchain\/chains\/llm_math\/base.py](https:\/\/github.com\/langchain-ai\/langchain\/blob\/-\/libs\/langchain\/langchain\/chains\/llm_math\/base.py)\n\n---\nThis response is meant to be useful, save you time, and share context. It is **not meant to be a precise solution**, but rather a starting point for your own research.\n\nHelp me be more useful!

                        "body":"@hinthornw As an alternative, we could use `sympy.sympify`? It's a common alternative to `eval` \/ `numexpr` (see this thread on vulnerabilities in [numexpr](https:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/10076300\/python-using-sympy-sympify-to-perform-a-safe-eval-on-mathematical-functions)). As well as avoiding that vulnerability, `sympy` also supports a much larger range of mathematical operations (i.e. rounding, factorials, etc.) and is about 10x as common as `numexpr` (as measured by github stars), so I'd guess its easier for an LLM to generate syntactically correct input (in fact, I spent about 10mins trying to get GPT-3 to generate a mathematical input that `sympy` *couldn't* process, and failed).\r\n\r\nI was testing some multi-step QA workflows inspired by a Langchain multi-step agent QA [workflow](https:\/\/python.langchain.com\/docs\/modules\/agents\/how_to\/intermediate_steps), and was using the `llm-math` tool in an Agent chain, with prompts like: \"Who is Zoe Saldana's partner? What is their current age raised to the 0.43 power, rounded to 3sf?\". This would cause `numexpr` to throw an error, since the chain would try and fail to pass it some kind of rounding instruction.  This also happens with the factorial function in #3071. Both of these use cases are fixed by backing `LLMMathChain` with a `sympify` call.\r\n\r\nHappy to attach some examples \/ create a PR to scope out the replacement if people agree. It's what I've been using locally and it works great!",

However, our build pipeline fails because of any security vulnerabilities in the libraries shipped with our solutions. So, even though we are not using LangChain agents, we need to go through a formal approval process with our security team, and prove the vulnerable code is not actually used by our solutions, to be able to get an exception to release.  Additionally, once we publish our code on GitHub, GitHub Dependabot will flag these security vulnerabilities, and we need to address auto-cut tickets for our team. \r\n\r\nSo, it would be much easier, and safer, to ship code with zero security vulnerabilities in downstream dependencies.

We felt this was the best solution for the time being, and may reconsider moving the code back to `langchain` itself once we're satisfied with the interface and security profile it offers.\r\n\r\nAs the discussion here and in #6051 pointed out, the most thorough and most universally-compatible way to prevent undesirable SQL commands from being executed is to limit the database permissions granted to the chain. That way, the database itself prevents dangerous commands like `DROP TABLE` from being able to be executed. As a result, we're marking that `langchain-experimental` code with prominent security warnings advising users about the security risk and reminding them to limit the database permissions they grant the chain: #9867\r\n\r\nThanks for the report and the productive discussion here!",

We will move the current python tools and anything that depends on them into `langchain.experimental` and make that a separate package. This should remove CVEs from core langchain, while also hopefullying making it clear its experimental, and also allowing for prototyping\r\n2. I would encourage the creation of a separate `langchain_python` or the like respository where that uses wasm by default. we'd be happy to support this in a variety of ways (help setting up, help publicizing, help maintaining), but i think we'd prefer it to be a separate repository\r\n\r\nthoughts?",

                "body":"### Issue you'd like to raise.\r\n\r\n\r\nTL;DR: The use of exec() in agents can lead to remote code execution vulnerabilities. Some Huggingface projects use such agents, despite the potential harm of LLM-generated Python code.\r\n\r\n\r\n#1026 and #814 discuss the security concerns regarding the use of `exec()` in llm_math chain.  The comments in #1026 proposed methods to sandbox the code execution, but due to environmental issues, the code was patched to replace `exec()` with `numexpr.evaluate()` (#2943). This restricted the execution capabilities to mathematical functionalities only. This bug was assigned the CVE number CVE-2023-29374. \r\n\r\nAs shown in the above issues, the usage of `exec()` in a chain can pose a significant security risk, especially when the chain is running on a remote machine. This seems common scenario for projects in Huggingface. \r\n\r\nHowever, in the latest langchain, `exec()` is still used in `PythonReplTool` and `PythonAstReplTool`. \r\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/hwchase17\/langchain\/blob\/aec642febb3daa7dbb6a19996aac2efa92bbf1bd\/langchain\/tools\/python\/tool.py#L55\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/hwchase17\/langchain\/blob\/aec642febb3daa7dbb6a19996aac2efa92bbf1bd\/langchain\/tools\/python\/tool.py#L102\r\n\r\nThese functions are called by Pandas Dataframe Agent, Spark Dataframe Agent, CSV Agent. It seems they are intentionally designed to pass the LLM output to `PythonAstTool` or `PythonAstReplTool` to execute the LLM-generated code in the machine.\r\n\r\nThe documentation for these agents explicitly states that they should be used with caution since LLM-generated Python code can be potentially harmful. For instance:\r\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/hwchase17\/langchain\/blob\/aec642febb3daa7dbb6a19996aac2efa92bbf1bd\/docs\/modules\/agents\/toolkits\/examples\/pandas.ipynb#L12\r\n\r\nDespite this, I have observed several projects in Huggingface using `create_pandas_dataframe_agent` and `create_csv_agent`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Suggestion:\r\n\r\n\r\nFixing this issue as done in llm_math chain seems challenging.\r\nSimply restricting the LLM-generated code to Pandas and Spark execution might not be sufficient because there are still numerous malicious tasks that can be performed using those APIs. For instance, Pandas can read and write files.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, it seems crucial to emphasize the security concerns related to LLM-generated code for the overall security of LLM apps. Merely limiting execution to specific frameworks or APIs may not fully address the underlying security risks. \r\n\r\n",

The documentation for this tool does not provide a warning about its potential safety concerns. (https:\/\/python.langchain.com\/en\/latest\/modules\/agents\/tools\/examples\/bash.html?highlight=shell)\r\n\r\nHowever, within the code itself, there is a cautionary message stating that it may be unsafe to use the tool.\r\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/hwchase17\/langchain\/blob\/99a1e3f3a309852da989af080ba47288dcb9a348\/langchain\/tools\/shell\/tool.py#L32-L35\r\n\r\nIt would be advisable to include a warning in the documentation to alert users about the potential risks involved.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, when utilizing the shell tool in an LLM application running on a server, it is possible for malicious users to exploit it, gaining control over the shell command execution and potentially running arbitrary code on the server. Similarly, if the LLM application is running on a local machine and receives untrusted data as input, such as a malicious webpage or untrusted files, the generated shell command by the LLM can be manipulated by this untrusted data, enabling the execution of arbitrary code on the local machine. It is crucial to be aware of these security risks when using the shell tool in such scenarios.\r\n",

                        "body":"_\ud83e\udd16_\n<!-- Greeting -->\nHello @Vegoo89,\n\nI'm [Dosu](https:\/\/dosu.dev), an automated assistant here to help you with your issues, answer questions, and guide you in becoming a contributor while we wait for a human maintainer. I'm here to make your experience with LangChain as smooth as possible. Let's get started with your issue!\n\n<!-- Answer -->\nThank you for bringing this to our attention. The `PythonREPL` component, which currently exists in the base library, can indeed be moved exclusively to the `experimental` version of `langchain` to address security concerns. This can be done by moving the entire `PythonREPL` class definition to the appropriate file in the `experimental` version of the library.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. Cut the entire `PythonREPL` class from the `libs\/langchain\/langchain\/utilities\/python.py` file.\n\n```py\nclass PythonREPL(BaseModel):\n    \"\"\"Simulates a standalone Python REPL.\"\"\"\n\n    globals: Optional[Dict] = Field(default_factory=dict, alias=\"_globals\")\n    locals: Optional[Dict] = Field(default_factory=dict, alias=\"_locals\")\n\n    @classmethod\n    def worker(\n        cls,\n        command: str,\n        globals: Optional[Dict],\n        locals: Optional[Dict],\n        queue: multiprocessing.Queue,\n    ) -> None:\n        old_stdout = sys.stdout\n        sys.stdout = mystdout = StringIO()\n        try:\n            exec(command, globals, locals)\n            sys.stdout = old_stdout\n            queue.put(mystdout.getvalue())\n        except Exception as e:\n            sys.stdout = old_stdout\n            queue.put(repr(e))\n\n    def run(self, command: str, timeout: Optional[int] = None) -> str:\n        \"\"\"Run command with own globals\/locals and returns anything printed.\n        Timeout after the specified number of seconds.\"\"\"\n\n        # Warn against dangers of PythonREPL\n        warn_once()\n\n        queue: multiprocessing.Queue = multiprocessing.Queue()\n\n        # Only use multiprocessing if we are enforcing a timeout\n        if timeout is not None:\n            # create a Process\n            p = multiprocessing.Process(\n                target=self.worker, args=(command, self.globals, self.locals, queue)\n            )\n\n            # start it\n            p.start()\n\n            # wait for the process to finish or kill it after timeout seconds\n            p.join(timeout)\n\n            if p.is_alive():\n                p.terminate()\n                return \"Execution timed out\"\n        else:\n            self.worker(command, self.globals, self.locals, queue)\n        # get the result from the worker function\n        return queue.get()\n```\n\n2. Paste the `PythonREPL` class into the appropriate file in the `experimental` version of the library.\n\nRemember to also move any dependencies that `PythonREPL` has, such as the `warn_once` function and any imported modules, to ensure that the class continues to function correctly.\n\nThis issue has been addressed before in the LangChain repository. You can refer to the following issues and pull requests for more information:\n\n- [Issue: what string works for experimental tool](https:\/\/github.com\/langchain-ai\/langchain\/issues\/13856)\n- [Remove `python_repl` from _BASE_TOOLS](https:\/\/github.com\/langchain-ai\/langchain\/pull\/13962)\n- [Remove `python_repl` from _BASE_TOOLS (#13962)](https:\/\/github.com\/Nghiauet\/langchain\/commit\/5ccdf94985f8fd6c16aa7b65e2708415cbf175c7)\n\nPlease let me know if you need further assistance.\n\n## Sources\n- [Issue: what string works for experimental tool](https:\/\/github.com\/langchain-ai\/langchain\/issues\/13856)\n- [libs\/langchain\/langchain\/utilities\/python.py](https:\/\/github.com\/langchain-ai\/langchain\/blob\/master\/libs\/langchain\/langchain\/utilities\/python.py)\n\n---\n\nThis response is meant to be useful and save you time.

        "README_content":"isURLInPortal patch for Plone\n=============================\n\nThis patches the ``isURLInPortal`` method in Plone.\nThe method is in ``Products.CMFPlone\/URLTool.py`` in the ``URLTool`` class.\nBasic use in a page template is::\n\n  <a\n    tal:define=\"url request\/came_from\"\n    tal:attributes=\"href url\"\n    tal:condition=\"python:context.portal_url.isURLInPortal(url)\">\n      This link is only shown when it is somewhere in the Plone portal.\n  <\/a>\n\n\nWhat does isURLInPortal do?\n---------------------------\n\nThe ``isURLInPortal`` method in Plone is used in several places.\nIt checks if a url is (probably) within the current Plone Site.\nIf so, then this url is safe to redirect to, or is safe to show on a page.\n\nFor example, if your site is ``http:\/\/demo.plone.org``, then these urls are in the site:\n\n- Full url: ``http:\/\/demo.plone.org\/some-folder\/some-page``\n- Relative url: ``some-folder\/some-page``, ``\/somewhere\/else``, ``..\/in\/parent``\n\nAnd these are not in the site:\n\n- ``example.org``\n- ``otherdomain.plone.org``\n\nThe code does *not* check if something is actually found at the url.\nIt only checks if the url would be within the site.\n\nIf this method fails to do its job, then an attacker could do a successful hack.\nAn attack can look like this:\n\n- An attacker sends you an email with a specially crafted link.\n  Or the attacker posts this link on a popular site that you visit.\n- The link is to a Plone Site that you know and trust, so you click it.\n- You see the expected Plone Site.  Maybe you login, but this may not be needed.\n\nAnd then one of the following things happens:\n\n- Open redirection: Somewhere on the page is a link to a malicious site.\n  In a fishing attack, this site may look like the Plone Site you expect.\n- Open redirection: You are *automatically* redirected to a malicious site.\n- Reflected XSS (Cross Site Scripting):\n  Malicious javascript is loaded that grabs private information from the page and sends it to the attacker.\n  Or it is used to create content in your name, with more malicious code, or with spam.\n- Stored XSS: If you are logged in as Editor in Plone, malicious javascript is stored, which is loaded by other visitors.\n\nLet's not list the sort of urls that might have tricked this method in the past:\nthere is no need to give hackers and script kiddies more ideas.\n\n\nHotfixes\n--------\n\nDuring the years, there have been various security hotfixes that patch this method.\nUsually this is because someone has alerted the `Plone Security Team <mailto:security@plone.org>`_ to a possible hack.\nIf we see that there is indeed a security problem, then we have to decide whether to publish a hotfix or not.\n\nIt may feel like overkill to create a hotfix for this and alert the entire Plone community, advising them to patch all their sites.\nA lot of them may not be vulnerable.\nFor example:\n\n- Modern browsers have protection against some of this, especially reflected XSS.\n  We have had reports that we could not initially reproduce because of this.\n- Some attacks are only for authenticated users.\n  The frontend web server may have been setup to redirect the login form to a server that is only available internally.\n- Some attacks are only for sites that have open registration, where everyone can make an account.\n  This is probably not the case for most Plone sites.\n- There may be a firewall in place that protects against these attacks.\n  The vulnerable request may not even reach Plone.\n\nAn extra problem: multiple hotfixes patch the same method.\nIf you have Plone 4.3.0, and you have installed all hotfixes, then you have eleven of them.\nSeveral of these patch this method.\nIf you load the oldest hotfix first, then it should work okay.\nThe other way around may even also work, although it is not recommended.\n\nBut we don't test the hotfixes in combination with *all* other hotfixes.\nWe sometimes test with a few though, and in some cases a new hotfix explicitly tries to load an older hotfix first.\n\nAnd it has a (probably small) impact on performance:\nmost hotfixed versions of this method do their specific check, and then call the original method.\nSo it may look like this:\n\n- A call is made to ``isURLInPortal``.\n- This method is patched by ``PloneHotfix20200121``, so it executes its own code, and then calls the original method.\n- This method is patched by ``PloneHotfix20171128``, so it executes its own code, and then calls the original method.\n- This finally is the code in ``CMFPlone``.\n- The three versions have overlap, leading to the same code being executed two or three times.\n\n\nIdea: separate package\n----------------------\n\nThe idea now is: let's put this method into a separate package.\nThis package would work as hotfix for all current Plone versions, or at least 4.3 and higher.\nNewer releases of CMFPlone would depend on this package, so it is automatically included.\nThe new package would be the canonical place of the method.\nWe would remove the method from newer CMFPlone releases.\n\nIf a new vulnerability is then detected, we would fix it and release a new version of this package.\nFixing your site would then be:\n\n- Edit the version number of the new package in the versions section of your buildout.\n- Stop the site.\n- Run buildout.\n- Start the site.\n\nWe could still announce it as a hotfix if we want.\n\nSince all hotfixes are in the ``Products`` namespace, we put this package in the same namespace.\nCode in this namespace is automatically loaded by Plone\/Zope.\nAlso, this makes it easier to extract the main directory (``isurlinportal``) of this package and put it in an old-style ``products`` folder.\nThen you can just restart Plone without having to run buildout.\nThis is mainly an issue for older Plone sites that have not been maintained well.\n\n\nVersion numbers\n---------------\n\nYou should always use the latest version of this package that is compatible with your Plone version.\n\n- Major\/breaking release, X.0.0:\n  Likely a new vulnerability was patched.\n  Please update as soon as possible.\n  But this may drop support for an older Plone or Python version, so read the changelog.\n  If you have an older Plone, check if there is an older update.\n- Minor\/feature release: x.Y.0:\n  A new vulnerability was patched.\n  Please update as soon as possible.\n- Micro\/bugfix release: x.y.Z:\n  A bug was fixed, but no new vulnerability was patched.\n  Update at a time of your choosing, or if you experience problems.\n\nVersion 1.x is compatible with Plone 4.3, 5.0, 5.1, 5.2, 6.0.\nVersion 2.x is compatible with Plone 6.0.\nVersion 3.x is compatible with Plone 6.1 and higher.\n\n\nReporting vulnerabilities or bugs\n---------------------------------\n\nIf you suspect you have found a vulnerability, please contact the `Plone Security Team <mailto:security@plone.org>`_ by email.\nIf you prefer a more secure way, we can also arrange that via email.\n\nIf you see a non-security bug, you can open an issue, or create a pull request.\nWhen in doubt, please email us.\n",

See\nhttps:\/\/palletsprojects.com\/security, the canonical location for the policy,\nwhich this is copied from.\n\n## Before Reporting\n\nThere are some things we generally do not consider security issues, which can be\nfound at the canonical policy page: https:\/\/palletsprojects.com\/security. Please\nreview the list before reporting an issue. You may still err on the side of\ncaution and make a private report first, but we may close it or ask you to\nreport a regular issue instead.\n\n## Reporting a Security Issue\n\nIf you believe you have identified a security issue with a Pallets or\nPallets-Eco project, **do not open a public issue**. To responsibly report a\nsecurity issue, use GitHub's [security advisory system][gh-docs]. From the\nproject's repository, click \"Security\" at the top, then click \"Advisories\" at\nthe left, then click the green \"New draft security advisory\" button.\nAlternatively, you may email [security@palletsprojects.com](mailto:security@palletsprojects.com),\nand we will convert that to a GitHub security advisory.\n\nBe sure to include as much detail as necessary in your report. As with reporting\nnormal issues, a minimal reproducible example will help the maintainers address\nthe issue faster. Information about why the issue is a security issue is also\nhelpful. If you are able, you may also provide a fix for the issue.\n\nA maintainer will reply acknowledging the report and how to continue. We will\nobtain a CVE id as well, please do not do this on your own. We will work with\nyou to attempt to understand the issue and decide on its validity. Maintainers\nare volunteers working in their free time, and therefore cannot guarantee any\nspecific timeline. Please be patient during this process.\n\nThe current feature release will receive security fixes. A backport to the\nprevious feature branch may be considered upon request based on usage information\nand severity, but is not guaranteed.\n\n[gh-docs]: https:\/\/docs.github.com\/en\/code-security\/security-advisories\/working-with-repository-security-advisories\/creating-a-repository-security-advisory\n",

AGE is an acronym for A Graph Extension and is inspired by Bitnine's AgensGraph, a multi-model database fork of PostgreSQL. The basic principle of the project is to create a single storage that handles both the relational and graph data model so that the users can use the standard ANSI SQL along with openCypher, one of the most popular graph query languages today. There is a strong need for cohesive, easy-to-implement multi-model databases. As an extension of PostgreSQL, AGE supports all the functionalities and features of PostgreSQL while also offering a graph model to boot.\n<\/br>\n<\/br>\n<\/br>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"\/img\/age-01.png\" width=\"80%\" height=\"80%\">\n<\/p>\n\n<\/br>\n\n\n<h2><img height=\"30\" src=\"\/img\/tick.svg\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Overview<\/h2>\n\nApache AGE is :\n\n- **Powerful**: adds graph database support to the already popular PostgreSQL database: PostgreSQL is used by organizations including Apple, Spotify, and NASA.\n- **Flexible**: allows you to perform openCypher queries, which makes complex queries much easier to write. It also enables querying multiple graphs at the same time.\n- **Intelligent**: allows you to perform graph queries that are the basis for many next-level web services such as fraud detection, master data management, product recommendations, identity and relationship management, experience personalization, knowledge management, and more.\n\n<h2><img height=\"30\" src=\"\/img\/features.svg\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Features<\/h2>\n<\/br>\n<\/br>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"\/img\/age-03.png\" width=\"80%\" height=\"80%\">\n<\/p>\n<\/br>\n\n- **Cypher Query**: supports graph query language\n- **Hybrid Querying**: enables SQL and\/or Cypher\n- **Querying**: enables multiple graphs\n- **Hierarchical**: graph label organization\n- **Property Indexes**: on both vertices(nodes) and edges\n- **Full PostgreSQL**: supports PG features\n\n\n\n<h2><img height=\"30\" src=\"\/img\/documentation.svg\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Documentation<\/h2>\n\nRefer to our latest [Apache AGE documentation](https:\/\/age.apache.org\/age-manual\/master\/index.html) to learn about installation, features, built-in functions, and  Cypher queries.\n\n\n\n<h2><img height=\"30\" src=\"\/img\/installation.svg\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Pre-Installation<\/h2>\n\nInstall the following essential libraries according to each OS. Building AGE from the source depends on the following Linux libraries (Ubuntu package names shown below):\n\n- **CentOS**\n```bash\nyum install gcc glibc glib-common readline readline-devel zlib zlib-devel flex bison\n```\n- **Fedora**\n```bash\ndnf install gcc glibc bison flex readline readline-devel zlib zlib-devel\n```\n- **Ubuntu**\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install build-essential libreadline-dev zlib1g-dev flex bison\n```\n\n<h2><img height=\"30\" src=\"\/img\/installation.svg\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Installation<\/h2>\n\nApache AGE is intended to be simple to install and run. It can be installed with Docker and other traditional ways. \n\n<h4><a><img width=\"20\" src=\"\/img\/pg.svg\"><\/a>\n&nbsp;Install PostgreSQL\n<\/h4>\n\nYou will need to install an AGE compatible version of Postgres<a>, for now AGE supports Postgres 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 & 16. Supporting the latest versions is on AGE roadmap.\n\n<h4>\n&nbsp;Installation via Package Manager\n<\/h4>\n\nYou can use a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.postgresql.org\/download\/\">package management <\/a> that your OS provides to download PostgreSQL.\n\n<br>\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install postgresql\n\n```\n<h4>\n&nbsp;Installation From Source Code\n<\/h4>\n\nYou can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.postgresql.org\/ftp\/source\/\"> download the Postgres <\/a> source code and install your own instance of Postgres. You can read instructions on how to install from source code for different versions on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.postgresql.org\/docs\/16\/installation.html\">official Postgres Website.<\/a>\n\n\n\n<h4><img width=\"20\" src=\"\/img\/tux.svg\"><img width=\"20\" src=\"\/img\/apple.svg\"> &nbsp;Install AGE on Linux and MacOS\n<\/h4>\n\nClone the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/apache\/age\">github repository<\/a> or download the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/apache\/age\/releases\">download an official release.\n<\/a>\nRun the pg_config utility and check the version of PostgreSQL. Currently, only PostgreSQL versions 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 & 16 are supported. If you have any other version of Postgres, you will need to install PostgreSQL version 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, or 16.\n<br>\n    \n```bash\npg_config\n```\nRun the following command in the source code directory of Apache AGE to build and install the extension.  \n     \n```bash\nmake install\n```\n     \nIf the path to your Postgres installation is not in the PATH variable, add the path in the arguments:\n```bash\nmake PG_CONFIG=\/path\/to\/postgres\/bin\/pg_config install\n```\n\n\n<h4><\/a><img width=\"30\" src=\"\/img\/docker.svg\"><\/a>\n&nbsp;Run using Docker\n<\/h4>\n\n<h5> Get the docker image <\/h5>\n\n```bash\ndocker pull apache\/age\n\n```\n<h5> Create AGE docker container <\/h5>\n\n```bash\ndocker run \\\n    --name age  \\\n    -p 5455:5432 \\\n    -e POSTGRES_USER=postgresUser \\\n    -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgresPW \\\n    -e POSTGRES_DB=postgresDB \\\n    -d \\\n    apache\/age\n```\n\n<h5> Enter PostgreSQL's psql: <\/h5>\n\n```bash\ndocker exec -it age psql -d postgresDB -U postgresUser\n```\n\n\n\n<h2><img height=\"20\" src=\"\/img\/contents.svg\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Post Installation<\/h2>\n\nFor every connection of AGE you start, you will need to load the AGE extension.\n\n```bash\nCREATE EXTENSION age;\n```\n```bash\nLOAD 'age';\n```\n```bash\nSET search_path = ag_catalog, \"$user\", public;\n```\n\n\n\n<h2><img height=\"20\" src=\"\/img\/contents.svg\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Quick Start<\/h2>\n\nTo create a graph, use the create_graph function located in the ag_catalog namespace.\n\n```bash\nSELECT create_graph('graph_name');\n```\n\nTo create a single vertex with label and properties, use the CREATE clause.\n\n```bash\nSELECT * \nFROM cypher('graph_name', $$\n    CREATE (:label {property:\"Node A\"})\n$$) as (v agtype);\n```\n\n```bash\nSELECT * \nFROM cypher('graph_name', $$\n    CREATE (:label {property:\"Node B\"})\n$$) as (v agtype);\n```\n\nTo create an edge between two nodes and set its properties:\n\n```bash\nSELECT * \nFROM cypher('graph_name', $$\n    MATCH (a:label), (b:label)\n    WHERE a.property = 'Node A' AND b.property = 'Node B'\n    CREATE (a)-[e:RELTYPE {property:a.property + '<->' + b.property}]->(b)\n    RETURN e\n$$) as (e agtype);\n```\n\nAnd to query the connected nodes:\n\n```\nSELECT * from cypher('graph_name', $$\n        MATCH (V)-[R]-(V2)\n        RETURN V,R,V2\n$$) as (V agtype, R agtype, V2 agtype);\n```\n\n<h2><img height=\"20\" src=\"\/img\/gettingstarted.svg\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Language Specific Drivers<\/h2>\n\nStarting with Apache AGE is very simple.

See\nhttps:\/\/palletsprojects.com\/security, the canonical location for the policy,\nwhich this is copied from.\n\n## Before Reporting\n\nThere are some things we generally do not consider security issues, which can be\nfound at the canonical policy page: https:\/\/palletsprojects.com\/security. Please\nreview the list before reporting an issue. You may still err on the side of\ncaution and make a private report first, but we may close it or ask you to\nreport a regular issue instead.\n\n## Reporting a Security Issue\n\nIf you believe you have identified a security issue with a Pallets or\nPallets-Eco project, **do not open a public issue**. To responsibly report a\nsecurity issue, use GitHub's [security advisory system][gh-docs]. From the\nproject's repository, click \"Security\" at the top, then click \"Advisories\" at\nthe left, then click the green \"New draft security advisory\" button.\nAlternatively, you may email [security@palletsprojects.com](mailto:security@palletsprojects.com),\nand we will convert that to a GitHub security advisory.\n\nBe sure to include as much detail as necessary in your report. As with reporting\nnormal issues, a minimal reproducible example will help the maintainers address\nthe issue faster. Information about why the issue is a security issue is also\nhelpful. If you are able, you may also provide a fix for the issue.\n\nA maintainer will reply acknowledging the report and how to continue. We will\nobtain a CVE id as well, please do not do this on your own. We will work with\nyou to attempt to understand the issue and decide on its validity. Maintainers\nare volunteers working in their free time, and therefore cannot guarantee any\nspecific timeline. Please be patient during this process.\n\nThe current feature release will receive security fixes. A backport to the\nprevious feature branch may be considered upon request based on usage information\nand severity, but is not guaranteed.\n\n[gh-docs]: https:\/\/docs.github.com\/en\/code-security\/security-advisories\/working-with-repository-security-advisories\/creating-a-repository-security-advisory\n",

It began as\na simple collection of various utilities for WSGI applications and has\nbecome one of the most advanced WSGI utility libraries.\n\nIt includes:\n\n-   An interactive debugger that allows inspecting stack traces and\n    source code in the browser with an interactive interpreter for any\n    frame in the stack.\n-   A full-featured request object with objects to interact with\n    headers, query args, form data, files, and cookies.\n-   A response object that can wrap other WSGI applications and handle\n    streaming data.\n-   A routing system for matching URLs to endpoints and generating URLs\n    for endpoints, with an extensible system for capturing variables\n    from URLs.\n-   HTTP utilities to handle entity tags, cache control, dates, user\n    agents, cookies, files, and more.\n-   A threaded WSGI server for use while developing applications\n    locally.\n-   A test client for simulating HTTP requests during testing without\n    requiring running a server.\n\nWerkzeug doesn't enforce any dependencies. It is up to the developer to\nchoose a template engine, database adapter, and even how to handle\nrequests. It can be used to build all sorts of end user applications\nsuch as blogs, wikis, or bulletin boards.\n\n[Flask][] wraps Werkzeug, using it to handle the details of WSGI while\nproviding more structure and patterns for defining powerful\napplications.\n\n[WSGI]: https:\/\/wsgi.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/\n[Flask]: https:\/\/www.palletsprojects.com\/p\/flask\/\n\n\n## A Simple Example\n\n```python\n# save this as app.py\nfrom werkzeug.wrappers import Request, Response\n\n@Request.application\ndef application(request: Request) -> Response:\n    return Response(\"Hello, World!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    from werkzeug.serving import run_simple\n    run_simple(\"127.0.0.1\", 5000, application)\n```\n\n```\n$ python -m app\n  * Running on http:\/\/127.0.0.1:5000\/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)\n```\n\n\n## Donate\n\nThe Pallets organization develops and supports Werkzeug and other\npopular packages. In order to grow the community of contributors and\nusers, and allow the maintainers to devote more time to the projects,\n[please donate today][].\n\n[please donate today]: https:\/\/palletsprojects.com\/donate\n",

First, sign up for a [W&B account](https:\/\/wandb.ai\/login?utm_source=github&utm_medium=code&utm_campaign=wandb&utm_content=quickstart).\n\n2. Second, install\u00a0the W&B SDK with [pip](https:\/\/pip.pypa.io\/en\/stable\/). Navigate to your terminal and type the following command:\n\n```bash\npip install wandb\n```\n\n3. Third, log into W&B:\n\n```python\nwandb.login()\n```\n\n4. Use the example code snippet below as a template to integrate W&B to your Python script:\n\n```python\nimport wandb\n\n# Start a W&B Run with wandb.init\nrun = wandb.init(project=\"my_first_project\")\n\n# Save model inputs and hyperparameters in a wandb.config object\nconfig = run.config\nconfig.learning_rate = 0.01\n\n# Model training code here ...\n\n# Log metrics over time to visualize performance with wandb.log\nfor i in range(10):\n    run.log({\"loss\": ...})\n\n# Mark the run as finished, and finish uploading all data\nrun.finish()\n```\n\nThat's it! Navigate to the W&B App to view a dashboard of your first W&B Experiment. Use the W&B App to compare multiple experiments in a unified place, dive into the results of a single run, and much more!\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src=\".\/assets\/wandb_demo_experiments.gif\" width=\"100%\">\n<\/p>\n<p align = \"center\">\nExample W&B Dashboard that shows Runs from an Experiment.\n<\/p>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# Integrations\n\nUse your favorite framework with W&B. W&B integrations make it fast and easy to set up experiment tracking and data versioning inside existing projects. For more information on how to integrate W&B with the framework of your choice, see the [Integrations chapter](https:\/\/docs.wandb.ai\/guides\/integrations) in the W&B Developer Guide.\n\n<!-- <p align='center'>\n<img src=\".\/assets\/integrations.png\" width=\"100%\" \/>\n<\/p> -->\n\n<details>\n<summary>\ud83d\udd25 PyTorch<\/summary>\n\nCall `.watch` and pass in your PyTorch model to automatically log gradients and store the network topology. Next, use `.log` to track other metrics. The following example demonstrates an example of how to do this:\n\n```python\nimport wandb\n\n# 1. Start a new run\nrun = wandb.init(project=\"gpt4\")\n\n# 2. Save model inputs and hyperparameters\nconfig = run.config\nconfig.dropout = 0.01\n\n# 3. Log gradients and model parameters\nrun.watch(model)\nfor batch_idx, (data, target) in enumerate(train_loader):\n    ...\n    if batch_idx % args.log_interval == 0:\n        # 4.

In order of what I think would be best to worst:\r\n-  Option 1: Scanning the dependencies of LTS release as part of a periodic GH Action (https:\/\/github.com\/actions\/dependency-review-action) on the LTS branches, with a step that fails in case any dependencies are vulnerable. The workflow can then either:\r\n   - Open an issue (https:\/\/github.com\/JasonEtco\/create-an-issue), e.g. \"release-X-LTS, vulnerable dependencies found\" which would require manual updating from our side\r\n   - Open a PR (https:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/68057744\/create-pull-request-with-github-action) to automatically update the dependencies - this might potentially get a bit too complicated and not worth the time (we'd also have to change this once we go from LTS releases that use the old `requirements` structure to the [new structure](https:\/\/github.com\/rucio\/rucio\/pull\/6767), unless we want to modify the LTS branches now to pin all dependencies in the same way that we're doing in the main branch\r\n- Option 2: Setting `open-pull-requests-limit` > 0 for LTS branches. The downside is that this will cause dependency upgrades for non-security updates too, which seems unnecessary.\r\n- Option 3: Manually updating the vulnerable dependencies in LTS branches whenever we get a security alert on the main branch; I think this relies too much on human effort. \r\n\r\n@bari12 thoughts?\r\n\r\nEdit: Another method, found [here](https:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/a\/71894638):\r\n- In the repo settings, we can switch default branch to an `LTS` branch, which triggers a Dependabot check right away and displays any vulnerabilities. On a regular basis (e.g. monthly) we could do:\r\n    1. Switch default branch to LTS branch\r\n    2. Check Dependabot vulnerabilities\r\n    3. Trigger Dependabot PRs for vulnerabilities, check CI passes, merge them\r\n    4. Switch default branch back to main branch\r\n\r\nThis is probably the simplest approach, but there might be downsides",

This was an existing issue, but Dependabot only saw it now because of the `noqa` comment that was added as part of this PR: https:\/\/github.com\/rucio\/rucio\/pull\/6703\/files.\r\n\r\nThe easiest solution according to https:\/\/github.com\/rucio\/rucio\/security\/dependabot\/15 would be to increase the lower bound version of `requests` to `2.32.0`. I'm in favour of this solution, as the current `requests` version range is not based on any specific requirements AFAIK.\r\n\r\nThe other solutions proposed are:\r\n- not using `verify=False` for the first request to a host while using a Requests Session - I'm not sure if this might break the functionality of that line\r\n- call `close()` on Session objects to clear existing connections if `verify=False` is used. - I think this is the safer\/simpler option from the point of view of not breaking current functionality.",

By using it, you agree to cede\ncontrol over minutiae of hand-formatting. In return, _Black_ gives you speed,\ndeterminism, and freedom from `pycodestyle` nagging about formatting. You will save time\nand mental energy for more important matters.\n\nBlackened code looks the same regardless of the project you're reading. Formatting\nbecomes transparent after a while and you can focus on the content instead.\n\n_Black_ makes code review faster by producing the smallest diffs possible.\n\nTry it out now using the [Black Playground](https:\/\/black.vercel.app). Watch the\n[PyCon 2019 talk](https:\/\/youtu.be\/esZLCuWs_2Y) to learn more.\n\n---\n\n**[Read the documentation on ReadTheDocs!](https:\/\/black.readthedocs.io\/en\/stable)**\n\n---\n\n## Installation and usage\n\n### Installation\n\n_Black_ can be installed by running `pip install black`. It requires Python 3.9+ to run.\nIf you want to format Jupyter Notebooks, install with `pip install \"black[jupyter]\"`.\n\nIf you can't wait for the latest _hotness_ and want to install from GitHub, use:\n\n`pip install git+https:\/\/github.com\/psf\/black`\n\n### Usage\n\nTo get started right away with sensible defaults:\n\n```sh\nblack {source_file_or_directory}\n```\n\nYou can run _Black_ as a package if running it as a script doesn't work:\n\n```sh\npython -m black {source_file_or_directory}\n```\n\nFurther information can be found in our docs:\n\n- [Usage and Configuration](https:\/\/black.readthedocs.io\/en\/stable\/usage_and_configuration\/index.html)\n\n_Black_ is already [successfully used](https:\/\/github.com\/psf\/black#used-by) by many\nprojects, small and big. _Black_ has a comprehensive test suite, with efficient parallel\ntests, and our own auto formatting and parallel Continuous Integration runner. Now that\nwe have become stable, you should not expect large formatting changes in the future.\nStylistic changes will mostly be responses to bug reports and support for new Python\nsyntax. For more information please refer to\n[The Black Code Style](https:\/\/black.readthedocs.io\/en\/stable\/the_black_code_style\/index.html).\n\nAlso, as a safety measure which slows down processing, _Black_ will check that the\nreformatted code still produces a valid AST that is effectively equivalent to the\noriginal (see the\n[Pragmatism](https:\/\/black.readthedocs.io\/en\/stable\/the_black_code_style\/current_style.html#ast-before-and-after-formatting)\nsection for details). If you're feeling confident, use `--fast`.\n\n## The _Black_ code style\n\n_Black_ is a PEP 8 compliant opinionated formatter. _Black_ reformats entire files in\nplace. Style configuration options are deliberately limited and rarely added. It doesn't\ntake previous formatting into account (see\n[Pragmatism](https:\/\/black.readthedocs.io\/en\/stable\/the_black_code_style\/current_style.html#pragmatism)\nfor exceptions).\n\nOur documentation covers the current _Black_ code style, but planned changes to it are\nalso documented. They're both worth taking a look at:\n\n- [The _Black_ Code Style: Current style](https:\/\/black.readthedocs.io\/en\/stable\/the_black_code_style\/current_style.html)\n- [The _Black_ Code Style: Future style](https:\/\/black.readthedocs.io\/en\/stable\/the_black_code_style\/future_style.html)\n\nChanges to the _Black_ code style are bound by the Stability Policy:\n\n- [The _Black_ Code Style: Stability Policy](https:\/\/black.readthedocs.io\/en\/stable\/the_black_code_style\/index.html#stability-policy)\n\nPlease refer to this document before submitting an issue. What seems like a bug might be\nintended behaviour.\n\n### Pragmatism\n\nEarly versions of _Black_ used to be absolutist in some respects. They took after its\ninitial author. This was fine at the time as it made the implementation simpler and\nthere were not many users anyway. Not many edge cases were reported. As a mature tool,\n_Black_ does make some exceptions to rules it otherwise holds.\n\n- [The _Black_ code style: Pragmatism](https:\/\/black.readthedocs.io\/en\/stable\/the_black_code_style\/current_style.html#pragmatism)\n\nPlease refer to this document before submitting an issue just like with the document\nabove. What seems like a bug might be intended behaviour.\n\n## Configuration\n\n_Black_ is able to read project-specific default values for its command line options\nfrom a `pyproject.toml` file. This is especially useful for specifying custom\n`--include` and `--exclude`\/`--force-exclude`\/`--extend-exclude` patterns for your\nproject.\n\nYou can find more details in our documentation:\n\n- [The basics: Configuration via a file](https:\/\/black.readthedocs.io\/en\/stable\/usage_and_configuration\/the_basics.html#configuration-via-a-file)\n\nAnd if you're looking for more general configuration documentation:\n\n- [Usage and Configuration](https:\/\/black.readthedocs.io\/en\/stable\/usage_and_configuration\/index.html)\n\n**Pro-tip**: If you're asking yourself \"Do I need to configure anything?\" the answer is\n\"No\". _Black_ is all about sensible defaults. Applying those defaults will have your\ncode in compliance with many other _Black_ formatted projects.\n\n## Used by\n\nThe following notable open-source projects trust _Black_ with enforcing a consistent\ncode style: pytest, tox, Pyramid, Django, Django Channels, Hypothesis, attrs,\nSQLAlchemy, Poetry, PyPA applications (Warehouse, Bandersnatch, Pipenv, virtualenv),\npandas, Pillow, Twisted, LocalStack, every Datadog Agent Integration, Home Assistant,\nZulip, Kedro, OpenOA, FLORIS, ORBIT, WOMBAT, and many more.\n\nThe following organizations use _Black_: Facebook, Dropbox, KeepTruckin, Lyft, Mozilla,\nQuora, Duolingo, QuantumBlack, Tesla, Archer Aviation.\n\nAre we missing anyone? Let us know.\n\n## Testimonials\n\n**Mike Bayer**, [author of `SQLAlchemy`](https:\/\/www.sqlalchemy.org\/):\n\n> I can't think of any single tool in my entire programming career that has given me a\n> bigger productivity increase by its introduction. I can now do refactorings in about\n> 1% of the keystrokes that it would have taken me previously when we had no way for\n> code to format itself.\n\n**Dusty Phillips**,\n[writer](https:\/\/smile.amazon.com\/s\/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=dusty+phillips):\n\n> _Black_ is opinionated so you don't have to be.\n\n**Hynek Schlawack**, [creator of `attrs`](https:\/\/www.attrs.org\/), core developer of\nTwisted and CPython:\n\n> An auto-formatter that doesn't suck is all I want for Xmas!\n\n**Carl Meyer**, [Django](https:\/\/www.djangoproject.com\/) core developer:\n\n> At least the name is good.\n\n**Kenneth Reitz**, creator of [`requests`](https:\/\/requests.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/)\nand [`pipenv`](https:\/\/readthedocs.org\/projects\/pipenv\/):\n\n> This vastly improves the formatting of our code. Thanks a ton!\n\n## Show your style\n\nUse the badge in your project's README.md:\n\n```md\n[![Code style: black](https:\/\/img.shields.io\/badge\/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https:\/\/github.com\/psf\/black)\n```\n\nUsing the badge in README.rst:\n\n```\n.. image:: https:\/\/img.shields.io\/badge\/code%20style-black-000000.svg\n    :target: https:\/\/github.com\/psf\/black\n```\n\nLooks like this:\n[![Code style: black](https:\/\/img.shields.io\/badge\/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https:\/\/github.com\/psf\/black)\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n## Contributing\n\nWelcome! Happy to see you willing to make the project better. You can get started by\nreading this:\n\n- [Contributing: The basics](https:\/\/black.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/contributing\/the_basics.html)\n\nYou can also take a look at the rest of the contributing docs or talk with the\ndevelopers:\n\n- [Contributing documentation](https:\/\/black.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/contributing\/index.html)\n- [Chat on Discord](https:\/\/discord.gg\/RtVdv86PrH)\n\n## Change log\n\nThe log has become rather long. It moved to its own file.\n\nSee [CHANGES](https:\/\/black.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/change_log.html).\n\n## Authors\n\nThe author list is quite long nowadays, so it lives in its own file.\n\nSee [AUTHORS.md](.\/AUTHORS.md)\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nEveryone participating in the _Black_ project, and in particular in the issue tracker,\npull requests, and social media activity, is expected to treat other people with respect\nand more generally to follow the guidelines articulated in the\n[Python Community Code of Conduct](https:\/\/www.python.org\/psf\/codeofconduct\/).\n\nAt the same time, humor is encouraged. In fact, basic familiarity with Monty Python's\nFlying Circus is expected. We are not savages.\n\nAnd if you _really_ need to slap somebody, do it with a fish while dancing.\n",

There exists a number of different tools to facilitate the formatting of drafts and RFCs according to the existing rules, and this tool, **xml2rfc**, is one of them. It takes as input an xml file that contains the text and meta-information about author names etc., and transforms it into suitably formatted output. The input xml file should follow the grammars in [RFC7749] *(for v2 documents)* or [RFC7991] *(for v3 documents)*. Note that the grammar for v3 is still being refined, and changes will eventually be captured in the [bis draft for 7991]. Changes not yet captured can be seen in the xml2rfc source [v3.rng], or in the [documentation xml2rfc produces] with its `--doc` flag.\n\n**xml2rfc** provides a variety of output formats. See the command line help for a full list of formats. It also provides conversion from v2 to v3, and can run the [preptool] on its input.\n\n### Installation\n\nInstallation of the python package is done as usual with `pip install xml2rfc`, using appropriate switches.\n\n#### Installation of support libraries for the PDF-formatter\n\nIn order to generate PDFs, **xml2rfc** uses the [WeasyPrint] module, which depends on external libraries that must be installed as native packages on your platform, separately from the **xml2rfc** install.\n\n1. First, install the **Pango**, and other required libraries on your system.  See installation instructions on the [WeasyPrint Docs].\n\n2. Next, install WeasyPrint python modules using pip.\n\n```sh\npip install xml2rfc[pdf]\n```\n3. Finally, install the required fonts:\n  * Download latest fonts from [xml2rfc-fonts](https:\/\/github.com\/ietf-tools\/xml2rfc-fonts\/releases\/latest).\n  * In the **Assets** section, download either the `tar.gz` or the `zip` archive.\n  * Extract the contents of the downloaded `xml2rfc-fonts` archive.\n  * Install the fonts found in the `noto` and `roboto_mono` directories to your operating system.\n\nWith these installed and available to **xml2rfc**, the `--pdf` switch will be enabled.\n\n### Usage\n\n**xml2rfc** accepts a single XML document as input and outputs to one or more conversion formats.\n\n#### Basic Usage\n\n```sh\nxml2rfc SOURCE [options] FORMATS...\n```\n\nRun `xml2rfc --help` for a full listing of command-line options.\n\n### Getting Started\n\nThis project is following the standard **Git Feature Workflow** development model. Learn about all the various steps of the development workflow, from creating a fork to submitting a pull request, in the [Contributing](https:\/\/github.com\/ietf-tools\/.github\/blob\/main\/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.\n\n> Make sure to read the [Styleguides](https:\/\/github.com\/ietf-tools\/.github\/blob\/main\/CONTRIBUTING.md#styleguides) section to ensure a cohesive code format across the project.\n\nYou can submit bug reports, enhancements and new feature requests in the [discussions](https:\/\/github.com\/ietf-tools\/xml2rfc\/discussions) area. Accepted tickets will be converted to issues.\n\n#### Git Cloning Tips\n\nAs outlined in the [Contributing](https:\/\/github.com\/ietf-tools\/.github\/blob\/main\/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide, you will first want to create a fork of the xml2rfc project in your personal GitHub account before cloning it.\n\nFor example *(replace `USERNAME` with your GitHub username)*:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https:\/\/github.com\/USERNAME\/xml2rfc.git\n```\n#### Docker Dev Environment\n\nRun `.\/run.sh` command to build and start a docker development environment.\nThe initial build may take time because it downloads all required fonts as well.\n\n\n```sh\n.\/run.sh\n```\n\n[IETF]: https:\/\/www.ietf.org\/\n[RFCs]: https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/\n[RFC7749]: https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/info\/rfc7749\n[RFC7991]: https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/info\/rfc7991\n[bis draft for 7991]: https:\/\/datatracker.ietf.org\/doc\/draft-iab-rfc7991bis\/\n[v3.rng]: xml2rfc\/data\/v3.rng\n[documentation xml2rfc produces]: https:\/\/ietf-tools.github.io\/xml2rfc\/\n[preptool]: https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/info\/rfc7998\n[WeasyPrint]: https:\/\/weasyprint.org\/\n[WeasyPrint Docs]: https:\/\/doc.courtbouillon.org\/weasyprint\/stable\/first_steps.html\n",
