See\nhttps://palletsprojects.com/security, the canonical location for the policy,\nwhich this is copied from.\n\n## Before Reporting\n\nThere are some things we generally do not consider security issues, which can be\nfound at the canonical policy page: https://palletsprojects.com/security. Please\nreview the list before reporting an issue. You may still err on the side of\ncaution and make a private report first, but we may close it or ask you to\nreport a regular issue instead.\n\n## Reporting a Security Issue\n\nIf you believe you have identified a security issue with a Pallets or\nPallets-Eco project, **do not open a public issue**. To responsibly report a\nsecurity issue, use GitHub's [security advisory system][gh-docs]. From the\nproject's repository, click \"Security\" at the top, then click \"Advisories\" at\nthe left, then click the green \"New draft security advisory\" button.\nAlternatively, you may email [security@palletsprojects.com](mailto:security@palletsprojects.com),\nand we will convert that to a GitHub security advisory.\n\nBe sure to include as much detail as necessary in your report. As with reporting\nnormal issues, a minimal reproducible example will help the maintainers address\nthe issue faster. Information about why the issue is a security issue is also\nhelpful. If you are able, you may also provide a fix for the issue.\n\nA maintainer will reply acknowledging the report and how to continue. We will\nobtain a CVE id as well, please do not do this on your own. We will work with\nyou to attempt to understand the issue and decide on its validity. Maintainers\nare volunteers working in their free time, and therefore cannot guarantee any\nspecific timeline. Please be patient during this process.\n\nThe current feature release will receive security fixes. A backport to the\nprevious feature branch may be considered upon request based on usage information\nand severity, but is not guaranteed.\n\n[gh-docs]: https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/creating-a-repository-security-advisory\n",

        "README_content": "# Werkzeug\n\n*werkzeug* German noun: \"tool\". Etymology: *werk* (\"work\"), *zeug* (\"stuff\")\n\nWerkzeug is a comprehensive [WSGI][] web application library. It began as\na simple collection of various utilities for WSGI applications and has\nbecome one of the most advanced WSGI utility libraries.\n\nIt includes:\n\n-   An interactive debugger that allows inspecting stack traces and\n    source code in the browser with an interactive interpreter for any\n    frame in the stack.\n-   A full-featured request object with objects to interact with\n    headers, query args, form data, files, and cookies.\n-   A response object that can wrap other WSGI applications and handle\n    streaming data.\n-   A routing system for matching URLs to endpoints and generating URLs\n    for endpoints, with an extensible system for capturing variables\n    from URLs.\n-   HTTP utilities to handle entity tags, cache control, dates, user\n    agents, cookies, files, and more.\n-   A threaded WSGI server for use while developing applications\n    locally.\n-   A test client for simulating HTTP requests during testing without\n    requiring running a server.\n\nWerkzeug doesn't enforce any dependencies. It is up to the developer to\nchoose a template engine, database adapter, and even how to handle\nrequests. It can be used to build all sorts of end user applications\nsuch as blogs, wikis, or bulletin boards.\n\n[Flask][] wraps Werkzeug, using it to handle the details of WSGI while\nproviding more structure and patterns for defining powerful\napplications.\n\n[WSGI]: https://wsgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n[Flask]: https://www.palletsprojects.com/p/flask/\n\n\n## A Simple Example\n\n```python\n# save this as app.py\nfrom werkzeug.wrappers import Request, Response\n\n@Request.application\ndef application(request: Request) -> Response:\n    return Response(\"Hello, World!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    from werkzeug.serving import run_simple\n    run_simple(\"127.0.0.1\", 5000, application)\n```\n\n```\n$ python -m app\n  * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)\n```\n\n\n## Donate\n\nThe Pallets organization develops and supports Werkzeug and other\npopular packages. In order to grow the community of contributors and\nusers, and allow the maintainers to devote more time to the projects,\n[please donate today][].\n\n[please donate today]: https://palletsprojects.com/donate\n",

You can use any of its components independently.\n\n```python\nfrom starlette.responses import PlainTextResponse\n\n\nasync def app(scope, receive, send):\n    assert scope['type'] == 'http'\n    response = PlainTextResponse('Hello, world!')\n    await response(scope, receive, send)\n```\n\nRun the `app` application in `example.py`:\n\n```shell\n$ uvicorn example:app\nINFO: Started server process [11509]\nINFO: Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)\n```\n\nRun uvicorn with `--reload` to enable auto-reloading on code changes.\n\n## Modularity\n\nThe modularity that Starlette is designed on promotes building re-usable\ncomponents that can be shared between any ASGI framework. This should enable\nan ecosystem of shared middleware and mountable applications.\n\nThe clean API separation also means it's easier to understand each component\nin isolation.\n\n---\n\n<p align=\"center\"><i>Starlette is <a href=\"https://github.com/encode/starlette/blob/master/LICENSE.md\">BSD licensed</a> code.<br/>Designed & crafted with care.</i></br>&mdash; ‚≠êÔ∏è &mdash;</p>\n\n[asgi]: https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n[httpx]: https://www.python-httpx.org/\n[jinja2]: https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/\n[python-multipart]: https://andrew-d.github.io/python-multipart/\n[itsdangerous]: https://itsdangerous.palletsprojects.com/\n[sqlalchemy]: https://www.sqlalchemy.org\n[pyyaml]: https://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAMLDocumentation\n[techempower]: https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#hw=ph&test=fortune&l=zijzen-sf\n",

It can also add\ncustom data, viewing options, and\n[passwords](https://pypdf.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/encryption-decryption.html)\nto PDF files. pypdf can\n[retrieve text](https://pypdf.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/extract-text.html)\nand\n[metadata](https://pypdf.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/metadata.html)\nfrom PDFs as well.\n\nSee [pdfly](https://github.com/py-pdf/pdfly) for a CLI application that uses pypdf to interact with PDFs.\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall pypdf using pip:\n\n```\npip install pypdf\n```\n\nFor using pypdf with AES encryption or decryption, install extra dependencies:\n\n```\npip install pypdf[crypto]\n```\n\n> **NOTE**: `pypdf` 3.1.0 and above include significant improvements compared to\n> previous versions. Please refer to [the migration\n> guide](https://pypdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/migration-1-to-2.html) for\n> more information.\n\n## Usage\n\n```python\nfrom pypdf import PdfReader\n\nreader = PdfReader(\"example.pdf\")\nnumber_of_pages = len(reader.pages)\npage = reader.pages[0]\ntext = page.extract_text()\n```\n\npypdf can do a lot more, e.g. splitting, merging, reading and creating\nannotations, decrypting and encrypting, and more. Check out [the\ndocumentation](https://pypdf.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for additional usage\nexamples!\n\nFor questions and answers, visit\n[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pypdf)\n(tagged with [pypdf](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pypdf)).\n\n## Contributions\n\nMaintaining pypdf is a collaborative effort. You can support the project by\nwriting documentation, helping to narrow down issues, and submitting code.\nSee the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) file for more information.\n\n### Q&A\n\nThe experience pypdf users have covers the whole range from beginners who\nwant to make their live easier to experts who developed software before PDF\nexisted. You can contribute to the pypdf community by answering questions\non [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pypdf),\nhelping in [discussions](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/discussions),\nand asking users who report issues for [MCVE](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example)'s (Code + example PDF!).\n\n\n### Issues\n\nA good bug ticket includes a MCVE - a minimal complete verifiable example.\nFor pypdf, this means that you must upload a PDF that causes the bug to occur\nas well as the code you're executing with all of the output. Use\n`print(pypdf.__version__)` to tell us which version you're using.\n\n### Code\n\nAll code contributions are welcome, but smaller ones have a better chance to\nget included in a timely manner. Adding unit tests for new features or test\ncases for bugs you've fixed help us to ensure that the Pull Request (PR) is fine.\n\npypdf includes a test suite which can be executed with `pytest`:\n\n```bash\n$ pytest\n===================== test session starts =====================\nplatform linux -- Python 3.6.15, pytest-7.0.1, pluggy-1.0.0\nrootdir: /home/moose/GitHub/Martin/pypdf\nplugins: cov-3.0.0\ncollected 233 items\n\ntests/test_basic_features.py ..

When I try to merge the file, I get a PdfReadError as follows:\r\n\r\nPdfReadError(\"Invalid Elementary Object starting with b'B' @145186168: b'MY+Courier#20New#20[Bold]\\\\n/DescendantFonts [ 5081 0 R ]\\\\n/Encoding /Identity-H\\\\n/S'\")\r\nPdfReadError(\"Invalid Elementary Object starting with b'B' @145329169: b'WV+Courier#20New#20[Bold]\\\\n/DescendantFonts [ 5093 0 R ]\\\\n/Encoding /Identity-H\\\\n/S'\")\r\nPdfReadError(\"Invalid Elementary Object starting with b'I' @149420585: b'ND+Courier#20New#20[Italic]\\\\n/DescendantFonts [ 5247 0 R ]\\\\n/Encoding /Identity-H\\\\n'\")\r\n\r\nNotice that the #5B and #D are decoded to '[' and ']' respectively, while the #20 (space) is still encoded. \r\n\r\n## Workaround\r\nSo I hex-edited the pdf file to replace each #5B and each #5D with #20 and then all the fonts come through okay. See two example outputs below. The second one has all the fonts and no missing glyphs with only the eitis to the source pdf.\r\n\r\n[184.out.bad.pdf](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/files/13933353/184.out.bad.pdf)\r\n[184.out.good.pdf](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/files/13933354/184.out.good.pdf)\r\n\r\nThe font name should support brackets and some other special characters, as it does the (#20, ' ', space) character. So, this looks like a special case where the parser is treating the [Bold] as the start and end of an array object, rather than a string.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The process seems to be causing errors during the extraction of PNG images, however, the JPEG images seem to be working just fine. The script I am using is as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport pypdf\r\nfrom PIL import Image\r\nimport io\r\n\r\ndoc = pypdf.PdfReader(\"data/big_lorem_multipic.pdf\")\r\n\r\nfor page in doc.pages:\r\n    for image in page.images:\r\n        #Approach 1\r\n        # with open(f\"data/{image.name}\", \"wb\") as file:\r\n        #     file.write(image.data)\r\n\r\n        # Approach 2\r\n        # image_bytes = io.BytesIO(image.data)\r\n        # pil_image = Image.open(image_bytes)\r\n        # pil_image.save(f\"data/{image.name}\")\r\n\r\n        # Approach 3\r\n        # image.image.save(f\"data/{image.name}\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll the three approaches produce the same issue in which the JPEG image is saved perfectly, but the PNG images are not. What seems to be the issue here? I can see that a related bug fix (https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/pull/1834) was recently made but I still cannot identify the cause of this issue.\r\n\r\nFor reference I am attaching the PDF below.

For example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pypdf import PdfReader, PdfWriter\r\n\r\n\r\n# PDF: https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/blob/main/resources/GeoBase_NHNC1_Data_Model_UML_EN.pdf\r\nreader = PdfReader(\"GeoBase_NHNC1_Data_Model_UML_EN.pdf\")\r\n\r\npage = reader.pages[0]\r\ncount = 0\r\n\r\nfor image_file_object in page.images:\r\n\twith open(str(count) + image_file_object.name, \"wb\") as fp:\r\n\t\tfp.write(image_file_object.data)\r\n\t\tcount += 1\r\n\r\nwriter = PdfWriter()\r\nwriter.add_page(page)\r\nwriter.remove_images()\r\n\r\nwith open(\"out.pdf\", \"wb\") as f:\r\n\twriter.write(f)\r\n```\r\nAs a result we get two images and a new PDF document without these images.

Nevertheless, it could be great to have a feature allowing to extract only raster graphics to separate files and don't touch vector graphics (or extract them but also with text which might be very hard as I guess).",

I'm not aware of another way of doing this with pypdf, but would be open to suggestions.\r\n\r\nOverall, this is quite a surprising result: I would expect pages to be self-contained, so that combining them wouldn't be a problem; but there may be complexities to PDF of which I'm not aware. (psutils in the past only worked with PostScript files.) If there's no reasonable solution, then I guess this situation should be detected so that it's possible to work with arbitrary PDF files without having this sort of stack exhaustion problem?\r\n\r\nThe PSUtils package has no interest in the contents of pages; it aims only to reorder, rotate, resize and possibly combine them (as here), while leaving the result \"the same\" as far as possible. Certainly visually, so indeed discarding annotations etc. would probably be fine for its usage, if there's an easy way to do that?",

Cryptography includes the same cryptographic primitives used in `pypdf` (AES and RC4), but is typically a smaller and more secure installation as it calls well vetted implementations rather than implementing them directly. It also is a dependency of `requests` via `urllib3`, and is [widely deployed](https://piptrends.com/compare/pycrypto-vs-pycryptodome-vs-cryptography). A quick check of conda-forge packages showed that PyCryptodome / PyCryptodomeEx was used in 25 packages versus 135 for Cryptography, and other packages such the [`pdfminer.six`](https://pdfminersix.readthedocs.io) have [made this migration earlier](https://github.com/pdfminer/pdfminer.six/pull/456).\r\n\r\nIf this is something that seems worthwhile, I can work on creating a PR for this effort. \r\n\r\ncc @exiledkingcc \r\n",

And after that PDF ‚Äúlooks‚Äù normal: vertical (portrait) orientation, but on deeper lever it is still a landscape one.

Many points have to be considered for that:\r\n* an error has been found in in transformation.ctm (fixed in #1341)\r\n* be carefull about signs /Rotate is clockwise positive where as transformation are trigonometric (counterclockwise positive)\r\n* rotate transformation center is at 0,0 therefore you need to translate before and after\r\n* the (visual) origin 0,0 is normally on lower/left corner but when /Rotate exists the center moves to upper/left (Rotate=90), upper/right(Rotate =180), lower/right (Rotate=270) and be aware that the axis are turning simultaneously\r\n* when applying a rotation, the cropping area is introduced in content. To prevent that the easiest is to set expand to True\r\n\r\nwith the following code, I get:\r\n```python\r\nimport PyPDF2\r\n\r\nreader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(\"e:/Downloads/MyStampFin.pdf\")\r\nst = r.pages[0]\r\nwriter = PyPDF2.PdfWriter()\r\norg = PyPDF2.PdfReader(\"e:/Downloads/0004.pdf\")\r\npage = org.pages[0]\r\nst.add_transformation(\r\n    PyPDF2.Transformation()\r\n    .translate(-float(st.mediabox.getWidth()) / 2, -float(st.mediabox.getHeight()) / 2)\r\n    .rotate(90)\r\n    .translate(float(st.mediabox.getHeight()) / 2, float(st.mediabox.getWidth()) / 2),\r\n    True,\r\n)\r\npage.merge_page(st)\r\nwriter.add_page(page)\r\nwith open(\"e:/Downloads/MyStamp0a.pdf\", \"wb\") as fo:\r\n    writer.write(fo)\r\n```\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4083478/189490362-89eb6df5-34ca-40dc-9b3c-073c088adf9d.png)\r\n\r\nThis can also be applied with the stamp with /Rotate=90 (note the rotation with is reversed:\r\n```python\r\nimport PyPDF2\r\n\r\nreader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(\"e:/Downloads/MyStampFin90a.pdf\")\r\nst = r.pages[0]\r\nwriter = PyPDF2.PdfWriter()\r\norg = PyPDF2.PdfReader(\"e:/Downloads/998719.pdf\")\r\npage = org.pages[0]\r\nst.add_transformation(\r\n    PyPDF2.Transformation()\r\n    .translate(-float(st.mediabox.getWidth()) / 2, -float(st.mediabox.getHeight()) / 2)\r\n    .rotate(-90)\r\n    .translate(float(st.mediabox.getHeight()) / 2, float(st.mediabox.getWidth()) / 2),\r\n    True,\r\n)\r\npage.merge_page(st)\r\nwriter.add_page(page)\r\nwith open(\"e:/Downloads/MyStamp90a.pdf\", \"wb\") as fo:\r\n    writer.write(fo)\r\n```\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4083478/189490952-cbb66a26-824c-4731-982c-d436041f1332.png)\r\n\r\nSo @Nikita7x  you should be able to get a quick solution\r\n\r\n@MartinThoma, @MasterOdin \r\nIn order to improve the API I propose 2 new functions:\r\na) add a page.get_rotate() function : to retrieve the page /Rotate value\r\nb) add a page.transfer_rotate_to_content() function : to transfer the /Rotate flag into content (apply the good translation/rotations, change MediaBox/... and reset the translation field\r\n\r\nYour opinion",

                        "body": "Yes, the problem in this file is the xref objects. \r\n\r\nThe way PyPDF2 reads pdfs is it essentially searches for the xref table and parses it. It then uses additional dictionaries within the file in conjunction with the xref table to locate the various objects at their byte location. \r\n\r\nFor the outline in this example, PyPDF2 processes the /Trailer which points to the document /Root. Root points to the Outline dictionary at object 86 (id number) 0 (generation number). This object is missing. This object (the Outline Dictionary) is supposed to point to the First and Last children (outline items) and is used as the starting point to build the outline tree. The Outline Dictionary exists within the document, just at a different location (i.e., not at 86 0 R). Fixing such an issue is possible with some commercially available PDF software renderers, such as Adobe Acrobat or PDF XChange. However, from what I can tell, fixing such an issue is currently beyond PyPDF2's \"plug-n-play\" capabilities. I think it could be done with some one-off code specifically for this situation. However, it is probably easiest to simply open and re-save the document in Adobe Acrobat. \r\n\r\nFor the code base, we could consider adding some logic to the PdfReader code within `_get_outlines()` method such that if the /Catalog contains a reference to the /Outlines dictionary, but the reference is missing from the xref table, to manually parse the document's objects and attempt to infer it from the attributes defined in Table 152 of PDFv1.7 specification, then update the /Catalog/Outlines pointer value. That would probably be best implemented as part of a larger framework to handle misplaced and/or unreferenced objects rather than a one-off endeavor for this particular niche-bug. ",

Using the basic mechanism the free\r\nentries in the cross-reference table may form a linked list, with each free entry containing the object number of\r\nthe next. The first entry in the table (object number 0) shall always be free and shall have a generation number\r\nof 65,535; it is shall be the head of the linked list of free objects. The last free entry (the tail of the linked list)\r\nlinks back to object number 0. Using the second mechanism, the table may contain other free entries that link\r\nback to object number 0 and have a generation number of 65,535, even though these entries are not in the\r\nlinked list itself.\r\n\r\nAnd if you look those entries you can found that offset is object number if it is a free entry and they form a linked list of free entries.\r\n\r\nSo as I thought correct way to handle this is resolve indirect reference to NullObject.",

For large inline images this change speeds up this method by many orders of magnitude:\r\n\r\n- Instead of only reading single bytes from the stream it reads larger chunks of 8 kB and uses Python's really fast `find()` method to check for the `E` the token. Only when the token is found it falls back to the normal algorithm that detects the end of the inline image.\r\n- Instead of using an immutable `data` it uses `BytesIO` to collect the output which support much faster appends.",

The following PDF has similar restrictions and allows to reproduce the behaviour described here:\r\nhttps://download.novapdf.com/download/samples/pdf-example-encryption.pdf\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom PyPDF2 import PdfReader\r\nfilename = 'pdf-example-encryption.pdf'\r\nreader = PdfReader(filename)\r\nprint(reader.metadata)\r\n```\r\nThe above code will trigger the following error, irrespective of whether it is ran from a .py file or from a python shell (official or ptpython).\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 4, in <module>\r\n  File \"/home/moose/Github/py-pdf/PyPDF2/PyPDF2/_reader.py\", line 296, in documentInfo\r\n    return self.metadata\r\n  File \"/home/moose/Github/py-pdf/PyPDF2/PyPDF2/_reader.py\", line 274, in metadata\r\n    obj = self.trailer[TK.INFO]\r\n  File \"/home/moose/Github/py-pdf/PyPDF2/PyPDF2/generic.py\", line 644, in __getitem__\r\n    return dict.__getitem__(self, key).get_object()\r\n  File \"/home/moose/Github/py-pdf/PyPDF2/PyPDF2/generic.py\", line 222, in get_object\r\n    return self.pdf.get_object(self).get_object()\r\n  File \"/home/moose/Github/py-pdf/PyPDF2/PyPDF2/_reader.py\", line 1053, in get_object\r\n    raise PdfReadError(\"file has not been decrypted\")\r\nPyPDF2.errors.PdfReadError: file has not been decrypted\r\n```\r\nHowever if you run only the following code in a shell:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom PyPDF2 import PdfReader\r\nfilename = 'pdf-example-encryption.pdf'\r\nreader = PdfReader(filename)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen instead of running this line:\r\n`print(pdf_reader.metadata)`\r\n\r\njust type `pdf_reader.` and hit tab for autocompletion suggestions. Once the autocompletion suggestions have been shown this code will work:\r\n```python\r\nprint(reader.metadata)\r\nprint(reader.page[0].extract_text())\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow to make it work in a .py file so that it works in a \"non-interactive\" mode?",

However, the reluctance of the\r\nHigh Court to accept the presence of the accused\r\nNo.2 at the spot and our acceptance of the said\r\nfinding can reasonably lead to a conclusion that\r\nthe incident had occurred without any premeditation\r\non the part of the accused.

In   these\r\ncircumstances, if one learned judge of this Court\r\nhad taken the view that fourth exception to Section\r\n300 IPC is attracted, we are of the view that the\r\nsame   should   commend   to   us   for   acceptance   in   the\r\nfacts of the case.  The fourth exception to Section\r\n300 IPC may be conveniently reproduced hereunder:\r\n‚ÄúException   4   to   Section   300   IPC.   -\r\nCulpable homicide is not murder if it\r\nis committed without premeditation in\r\na sudden fight in the heat of passion\r\nupon a sudden quarrel and without the\r\noffender having taken undue advantage\r\n```\r\n\r\nLooks fine :-) ",

How about any future issues get closed with a link to #657 as an explanation?\r\n\r\nBack to this specific issue, this issue has nothing to do with #13, its specifically about the linked issue to a repo that no longer exists. I have the test code in https://github.com/claird/PyPDF4/issues/59 but the test pdf is only in the deleted repo (it was about 5Mb). @[mstamy2](https://github.com/mstamy2) is the original owner, I noticed he responded to #657  so pinging him in case the repo is simply private rather than deleted as that's where I put all my notes. @mstamy2 do you still have access to the https://github.com/mstamy2/PyPDF3/issues/13?\r\n\r\nI can try and check an old hard drive to see if I still have it but I won't have access to it for a while :-(",

I have confirmed that the large chunk of text is indeed in the PDF file as expected, but I can't figure out why it's pulling back that string instead of the value.\r\n\r\nI'm attaching a very simple PDF file that contains enough text in a single form to demonstrate the issue.\r\n\r\n[Simple form.pdf](https://github.com/mstamy2/PyPDF2/files/1948267/Simple.form.pdf)\r\n\r\nThis code snippet demonstrates how I'm trying to use the data from that field:\r\n\r\n                    # Extract the fields from the PDF\r\n                    input_file = PdfFileReader(open(local_filename, \"rb\"))\r\n\r\n                    # print how many pages input has:\r\n                    status(local_filename + \" has \" + str(input_file.getNumPages()) + \" pages.\\n\")\r\n\r\n                    # Get the form fields from the input file; returns a dict type\r\n                    try:\r\n                        my_fields = input_file.getFields()\r\n\r\n                    except Exception as myerr:\r\n                        status(\"[ERROR]: \"+str(myerr)+\"\\n\")\r\n\r\n                    if \"TimeStampData\" in my_fields:\r\n                        my_time_stamps = my_fields[\"TimeStampData\"]\r\n                        print(\"my_time_stamps  = \" + my_time_stamps + \"\\n\")\r\n\r\n\r\nThe output I get from that snippet is:\r\n\r\nmy_time_stamps = \"/FT\": \"/Tx\", \"/T\": \"TimeStampData\", \"/Ff\": 4096, \"/V\": {\"/Filter\": [\"/FlateDecode\"]}",

However, does that mean I'm stuck with named destinations with numbers and padding? Currently I am trying to use hashes for names since I am dynamically generating content and using hash names to reference them. The large hashes don't seem to work at all, not totally sure why. I don't see how padding is any different than random numbers/letters.\r\n\r\nHopefully someone in the know can chime in??",

This ends up being quadratic in the total length of the line, which is particularly noticeable when the line gets to be very long (e.g. 5MB of null bytes, which, since it has no `\\r` or `\\n` characters, is treated a single line). I'll open an issue with a fix as well as a way to monkey-patch `PdfFileReader` to work around it - I don't know if PyPDF2 is still being maintained but at least it'll be out there.",

For large inline images this change speeds up this method by many orders of magnitude:\r\n\r\n- Instead of only reading single bytes from the stream it reads larger chunks of 8 kB and uses Python's really fast `find()` method to check for the `E` the token. Only when the token is found it falls back to the normal algorithm that detects the end of the inline image.\r\n- Instead of using an immutable `data` it uses `BytesIO` to collect the output which support much faster appends.",

So this is probably a security issue because it might be possible to denial-of-service applications using PyPDF2.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that the last while-loop in [ContentStream._readInlineImage](https://github.com/mstamy2/PyPDF2/blob/2a9d76d1244444f7bdd1e8f42eaeee159eadf7fa/PyPDF2/pdf.py#L2772-L2818) only terminates when it finds the `EI` token, but never actually checks if the stream has already ended. So it's as simple as adding a (broken) inline image that doesn't have an `EI` token at all, like the attached PDF.\r\n\r\nYou can see the infinite loop by running this test script with the attached PDF:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport sys\r\n\r\nfrom PyPDF2 import PdfFileReader, PdfFileWriter\r\nfrom PyPDF2.pdf import ContentStream\r\n\r\nwith open(sys.argv[1], 'rb') as f:\r\n    pdf = PdfFileReader(f, strict=False)\r\n    for page in pdf.pages:\r\n        contentstream = ContentStream(page.getContents(), pdf)\r\n        for operands, command in contentstream.operations:\r\n            if command == b'INLINE IMAGE':\r\n                data = operands['data']\r\n                print(len(data))\r\n```\r\n\r\nI will soon prepare a pull request that fixes this issue.",

If keeping the underlying page structure is not important, use `appendPagesFromReader` to compact the page structure to a single page list with many page references.\n\nI think that `cloneDocumentFromReader` does not work like expected because `cloneDocumentFromReader` uses both of the above methods, which causes a conflict when trying to write the document. This conflict occurs because the writer, when looking for all of the external references gets caught up in two different versions of the same object with the same version history, tricking the writer into thinking that the content has already been loaded when it has not been.\n\nIf you open the PDF output of your program in a text editor, you will notice that there are many references to indirect objects that are never defined within the document.\n",

A very useful clone will be a raw clone byte by byte of the document, and make that subsequent modifications generate a new version.\n\nThat will also bring the library the power to preserve the digital signatures for past versions.\n\nAlso  [this kind of problems](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37576080/pypdf2-reportlab-mergepage-looses-original-pdf-custom-script) would be avoided.\n\nThis would also make the library stronger, because it could preserve even objects that it can not parse totally. As long as I have seen, it seems that all this kind of libraries work parsing all the content with the reader to its own DOM and then the writer knows how to write them. \n\nI mean the writer doesn't need to handle the semantic of all the existent objects in past versions, it can just include references to them, even when the reader doesn't know the semantic of the object. The object and past versions would be truly cloned.\n\nAm I missing something ?\n",

For clarification, see my comment from today (July-12-2022) on PDF specifications. \r\n\r\nIn this case, I wonder if it would be better to fix it by not throwing an error but issuing a user warning that the bookmark uses a named destination that is not defined. One could still keep the outline entry's title and location with document outline, continue to process the file. This would make the program much more flexibile. I also think this is pertinent to some of the changes I made in #1076 and should be accounted for before it is merged. Thoughts @MartinThoma?",

The upload settings should be on 'convert text and images from uploaded PDF'. Once uploaded, you can open the file with Microsoft Word and convert it back to a PDF (with no restrictions).\n\nI haven't had to use any of these methods myself, so I don't know for sure if they'll work, but hopefully you can resolve this.

When I try to merge the file, I get a PdfReadError as follows:\r\n\r\nPdfReadError(\"Invalid Elementary Object starting with b'B' @145186168: b'MY+Courier#20New#20[Bold]\\\\n/DescendantFonts [ 5081 0 R ]\\\\n/Encoding /Identity-H\\\\n/S'\")\r\nPdfReadError(\"Invalid Elementary Object starting with b'B' @145329169: b'WV+Courier#20New#20[Bold]\\\\n/DescendantFonts [ 5093 0 R ]\\\\n/Encoding /Identity-H\\\\n/S'\")\r\nPdfReadError(\"Invalid Elementary Object starting with b'I' @149420585: b'ND+Courier#20New#20[Italic]\\\\n/DescendantFonts [ 5247 0 R ]\\\\n/Encoding /Identity-H\\\\n'\")\r\n\r\nNotice that the #5B and #D are decoded to '[' and ']' respectively, while the #20 (space) is still encoded. \r\n\r\n## Workaround\r\nSo I hex-edited the pdf file to replace each #5B and each #5D with #20 and then all the fonts come through okay. See two example outputs below. The second one has all the fonts and no missing glyphs with only the eitis to the source pdf.\r\n\r\n[184.out.bad.pdf](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/files/13933353/184.out.bad.pdf)\r\n[184.out.good.pdf](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/files/13933354/184.out.good.pdf)\r\n\r\nThe font name should support brackets and some other special characters, as it does the (#20, ' ', space) character. So, this looks like a special case where the parser is treating the [Bold] as the start and end of an array object, rather than a string.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The process seems to be causing errors during the extraction of PNG images, however, the JPEG images seem to be working just fine. The script I am using is as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport pypdf\r\nfrom PIL import Image\r\nimport io\r\n\r\ndoc = pypdf.PdfReader(\"data/big_lorem_multipic.pdf\")\r\n\r\nfor page in doc.pages:\r\n    for image in page.images:\r\n        #Approach 1\r\n        # with open(f\"data/{image.name}\", \"wb\") as file:\r\n        #     file.write(image.data)\r\n\r\n        # Approach 2\r\n        # image_bytes = io.BytesIO(image.data)\r\n        # pil_image = Image.open(image_bytes)\r\n        # pil_image.save(f\"data/{image.name}\")\r\n\r\n        # Approach 3\r\n        # image.image.save(f\"data/{image.name}\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll the three approaches produce the same issue in which the JPEG image is saved perfectly, but the PNG images are not. What seems to be the issue here? I can see that a related bug fix (https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/pull/1834) was recently made but I still cannot identify the cause of this issue.\r\n\r\nFor reference I am attaching the PDF below.

For example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pypdf import PdfReader, PdfWriter\r\n\r\n\r\n# PDF: https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/blob/main/resources/GeoBase_NHNC1_Data_Model_UML_EN.pdf\r\nreader = PdfReader(\"GeoBase_NHNC1_Data_Model_UML_EN.pdf\")\r\n\r\npage = reader.pages[0]\r\ncount = 0\r\n\r\nfor image_file_object in page.images:\r\n\twith open(str(count) + image_file_object.name, \"wb\") as fp:\r\n\t\tfp.write(image_file_object.data)\r\n\t\tcount += 1\r\n\r\nwriter = PdfWriter()\r\nwriter.add_page(page)\r\nwriter.remove_images()\r\n\r\nwith open(\"out.pdf\", \"wb\") as f:\r\n\twriter.write(f)\r\n```\r\nAs a result we get two images and a new PDF document without these images.

Nevertheless, it could be great to have a feature allowing to extract only raster graphics to separate files and don't touch vector graphics (or extract them but also with text which might be very hard as I guess).",

I'm not aware of another way of doing this with pypdf, but would be open to suggestions.\r\n\r\nOverall, this is quite a surprising result: I would expect pages to be self-contained, so that combining them wouldn't be a problem; but there may be complexities to PDF of which I'm not aware. (psutils in the past only worked with PostScript files.) If there's no reasonable solution, then I guess this situation should be detected so that it's possible to work with arbitrary PDF files without having this sort of stack exhaustion problem?\r\n\r\nThe PSUtils package has no interest in the contents of pages; it aims only to reorder, rotate, resize and possibly combine them (as here), while leaving the result \"the same\" as far as possible. Certainly visually, so indeed discarding annotations etc. would probably be fine for its usage, if there's an easy way to do that?",

Cryptography includes the same cryptographic primitives used in `pypdf` (AES and RC4), but is typically a smaller and more secure installation as it calls well vetted implementations rather than implementing them directly. It also is a dependency of `requests` via `urllib3`, and is [widely deployed](https://piptrends.com/compare/pycrypto-vs-pycryptodome-vs-cryptography). A quick check of conda-forge packages showed that PyCryptodome / PyCryptodomeEx was used in 25 packages versus 135 for Cryptography, and other packages such the [`pdfminer.six`](https://pdfminersix.readthedocs.io) have [made this migration earlier](https://github.com/pdfminer/pdfminer.six/pull/456).\r\n\r\nIf this is something that seems worthwhile, I can work on creating a PR for this effort. \r\n\r\ncc @exiledkingcc \r\n",

And after that PDF ‚Äúlooks‚Äù normal: vertical (portrait) orientation, but on deeper lever it is still a landscape one.

Many points have to be considered for that:\r\n* an error has been found in in transformation.ctm (fixed in #1341)\r\n* be carefull about signs /Rotate is clockwise positive where as transformation are trigonometric (counterclockwise positive)\r\n* rotate transformation center is at 0,0 therefore you need to translate before and after\r\n* the (visual) origin 0,0 is normally on lower/left corner but when /Rotate exists the center moves to upper/left (Rotate=90), upper/right(Rotate =180), lower/right (Rotate=270) and be aware that the axis are turning simultaneously\r\n* when applying a rotation, the cropping area is introduced in content. To prevent that the easiest is to set expand to True\r\n\r\nwith the following code, I get:\r\n```python\r\nimport PyPDF2\r\n\r\nreader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(\"e:/Downloads/MyStampFin.pdf\")\r\nst = r.pages[0]\r\nwriter = PyPDF2.PdfWriter()\r\norg = PyPDF2.PdfReader(\"e:/Downloads/0004.pdf\")\r\npage = org.pages[0]\r\nst.add_transformation(\r\n    PyPDF2.Transformation()\r\n    .translate(-float(st.mediabox.getWidth()) / 2, -float(st.mediabox.getHeight()) / 2)\r\n    .rotate(90)\r\n    .translate(float(st.mediabox.getHeight()) / 2, float(st.mediabox.getWidth()) / 2),\r\n    True,\r\n)\r\npage.merge_page(st)\r\nwriter.add_page(page)\r\nwith open(\"e:/Downloads/MyStamp0a.pdf\", \"wb\") as fo:\r\n    writer.write(fo)\r\n```\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4083478/189490362-89eb6df5-34ca-40dc-9b3c-073c088adf9d.png)\r\n\r\nThis can also be applied with the stamp with /Rotate=90 (note the rotation with is reversed:\r\n```python\r\nimport PyPDF2\r\n\r\nreader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(\"e:/Downloads/MyStampFin90a.pdf\")\r\nst = r.pages[0]\r\nwriter = PyPDF2.PdfWriter()\r\norg = PyPDF2.PdfReader(\"e:/Downloads/998719.pdf\")\r\npage = org.pages[0]\r\nst.add_transformation(\r\n    PyPDF2.Transformation()\r\n    .translate(-float(st.mediabox.getWidth()) / 2, -float(st.mediabox.getHeight()) / 2)\r\n    .rotate(-90)\r\n    .translate(float(st.mediabox.getHeight()) / 2, float(st.mediabox.getWidth()) / 2),\r\n    True,\r\n)\r\npage.merge_page(st)\r\nwriter.add_page(page)\r\nwith open(\"e:/Downloads/MyStamp90a.pdf\", \"wb\") as fo:\r\n    writer.write(fo)\r\n```\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4083478/189490952-cbb66a26-824c-4731-982c-d436041f1332.png)\r\n\r\nSo @Nikita7x  you should be able to get a quick solution\r\n\r\n@MartinThoma, @MasterOdin \r\nIn order to improve the API I propose 2 new functions:\r\na) add a page.get_rotate() function : to retrieve the page /Rotate value\r\nb) add a page.transfer_rotate_to_content() function : to transfer the /Rotate flag into content (apply the good translation/rotations, change MediaBox/... and reset the translation field\r\n\r\nYour opinion",

                        "body": "Yes, the problem in this file is the xref objects. \r\n\r\nThe way PyPDF2 reads pdfs is it essentially searches for the xref table and parses it. It then uses additional dictionaries within the file in conjunction with the xref table to locate the various objects at their byte location. \r\n\r\nFor the outline in this example, PyPDF2 processes the /Trailer which points to the document /Root. Root points to the Outline dictionary at object 86 (id number) 0 (generation number). This object is missing. This object (the Outline Dictionary) is supposed to point to the First and Last children (outline items) and is used as the starting point to build the outline tree. The Outline Dictionary exists within the document, just at a different location (i.e., not at 86 0 R). Fixing such an issue is possible with some commercially available PDF software renderers, such as Adobe Acrobat or PDF XChange. However, from what I can tell, fixing such an issue is currently beyond PyPDF2's \"plug-n-play\" capabilities. I think it could be done with some one-off code specifically for this situation. However, it is probably easiest to simply open and re-save the document in Adobe Acrobat. \r\n\r\nFor the code base, we could consider adding some logic to the PdfReader code within `_get_outlines()` method such that if the /Catalog contains a reference to the /Outlines dictionary, but the reference is missing from the xref table, to manually parse the document's objects and attempt to infer it from the attributes defined in Table 152 of PDFv1.7 specification, then update the /Catalog/Outlines pointer value. That would probably be best implemented as part of a larger framework to handle misplaced and/or unreferenced objects rather than a one-off endeavor for this particular niche-bug. ",

Using the basic mechanism the free\r\nentries in the cross-reference table may form a linked list, with each free entry containing the object number of\r\nthe next. The first entry in the table (object number 0) shall always be free and shall have a generation number\r\nof 65,535; it is shall be the head of the linked list of free objects. The last free entry (the tail of the linked list)\r\nlinks back to object number 0. Using the second mechanism, the table may contain other free entries that link\r\nback to object number 0 and have a generation number of 65,535, even though these entries are not in the\r\nlinked list itself.\r\n\r\nAnd if you look those entries you can found that offset is object number if it is a free entry and they form a linked list of free entries.\r\n\r\nSo as I thought correct way to handle this is resolve indirect reference to NullObject.",

It is designed to use additional classical compute resources to execute quantum circuits with more efficiency on quantum processors, by including near-time computations such as error suppression and error mitigation. Examples of error suppression include dynamical decoupling, noise-aware compilation, error mitigation including readout mitigation, zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE), and probabilistic error cancellation (PEC).\n\nUsing the runtime service, a research team at IBM Quantum was able to achieve a 120x speedup\nin their lithium hydride simulation. For more information, see the\n[IBM Research blog](https://research.ibm.com/blog/120x-quantum-speedup).\n\nThis module provides the interface to access the Qiskit Runtime service on IBM Quantum Platform or IBM Cloud.\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can install this package using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install qiskit-ibm-runtime\n```\n\n## Account setup\n\n### Qiskit Runtime service on IBM Quantum Platform\n\nYou will need your IBM Quantum API token to authenticate with the runtime service:\n\n1. Create an IBM Quantum account or log in to your existing account by visiting the [IBM Quantum login page].\n\n1. Copy (and optionally regenerate) your API token from your\n   [IBM Quantum account page].\n\n### Qiskit Runtime service on IBM Cloud\n\nThe runtime service is now part of the IBM Quantum Services on IBM Cloud. To use this service, you'll\nneed to create an IBM Cloud account and a quantum service instance.\n[This guide](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/quantum-computing?topic=quantum-computing-get-started)\ncontains step-by-step instructions, including how to find your\nIBM Cloud API key and Cloud Resource Name (CRN), which you will need for authentication.\n\n\n### Save your account on disk\n\nOnce you have the account credentials, you can save them on disk, so you won't have to input\nthem each time. The credentials are saved in the `$HOME/.qiskit/qiskit-ibm.json` file, where `$HOME` is your home directory.\n\n| :warning: Account credentials are saved in plain text, so only do so if you are using a trusted device. |\n|:---------------------------|\n\n ```python\nfrom qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService\n\n# Save an IBM Cloud account.\nQiskitRuntimeService.save_account(channel=\"ibm_cloud\", token=\"MY_IBM_CLOUD_API_KEY\", instance=\"MY_IBM_CLOUD_CRN\")\n\n# Save an IBM Quantum account.\nQiskitRuntimeService.save_account(channel=\"ibm_quantum\", token=\"MY_IBM_QUANTUM_TOKEN\")\n```\n\nOnce the account is saved on disk, you can instantiate the service without any arguments:\n\n```python\nfrom qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService\nservice = QiskitRuntimeService()\n```\n\n### Loading account from environment variables\n\nAlternatively, the service can discover credentials from environment variables:\n```bash\nexport QISKIT_IBM_TOKEN=\"MY_IBM_CLOUD_API_KEY\"\nexport QISKIT_IBM_INSTANCE=\"MY_IBM_CLOUD_CRN\"\nexport QISKIT_IBM_CHANNEL=\"ibm_cloud\"\n```\n\nThen instantiate the service without any arguments:\n```python\nfrom qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService\nservice = QiskitRuntimeService()\n```\n\n### Enabling account for current Python session\n\nAs another alternative, you can also enable an account just for the current session by instantiating the\nservice with your credentials.\n\n```python\nfrom qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService\n\n# For an IBM Cloud account.\nibm_cloud_service = QiskitRuntimeService(channel=\"ibm_cloud\", token=\"MY_IBM_CLOUD_API_KEY\", instance=\"MY_IBM_CLOUD_CRN\")\n\n# For an IBM Quantum account.\nibm_quantum_service = QiskitRuntimeService(channel=\"ibm_quantum\", token=\"MY_IBM_QUANTUM_TOKEN\")\n```\n\n## Primitives\n\nAll quantum applications and algorithms level are fundamentally built using these steps:\n1. Map classical inputs to a quantum problem\n2. Translate¬†problem for optimized¬†quantum execution.\n3. Execute the quantum circuits by using a primitive (Estimator or Sampler).\n4. Post-process, return result in classical format.\n\n**Primitives** are base-level functions that serve as building blocks for many quantum algorithms and applications.\nPrimitives accept vectorized inputs, where single circuits can be grouped with array-valued specifications. That is, one circuit can be executed for arrays of n parameter sets, n observables, or both (in the case of the estimator). Each group is called a Primitive Unified Bloc (PUB), and can be represented as a tuple.\n\nThe [primitive interfaces](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/primitives) are defined in Qiskit.\n\nThe IBM Runtime service offers these primitives with additional features, such as built-in error suppression and mitigation.\n\nThere are several different options you can specify when calling the primitives. See [Primitive options](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/options) for more information.\n\n### Primitive versions\n\nVersion 2 of the primitives is introduced by `qiskit-ibm-runtime` release 0.21.0. Version 1 of the primitives is no longer supported. Refer to [Migrate to the V2 primitives](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/migration-guides/v2-primitives) on how to migratie to V2 primitives. The examples below all use V2 primitives.\n\n### Sampler\n\nThis primitive takes a list of user circuits (including measurements) as input and returns the sampling output. The type of the output is defined by the program (typically bit-arrays), and the output data is separated by the classical register names.\n\nTo invoke the `Sampler` primitive\n\n```python\nfrom qiskit import QuantumCircuit\nfrom qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers import generate_preset_pass_manager\nfrom qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService, SamplerV2 as Sampler\n\nservice = QiskitRuntimeService()\n\n# 1. A quantum circuit for preparing the quantum state (|00> + |11>)/rt{2}\nbell = QuantumCircuit(2)\nbell.h(0)\nbell.cx(0, 1)\nbell.measure_all()\n\n# 2: Optimize problem for quantum execution.\nbackend = service.least_busy(operational=True, simulator=False)\npm = generate_preset_pass_manager(backend=backend, optimization_level=1)\nisa_circuit = pm.run(bell)\n\n# 3. Execute using the Sampler primitive\nsampler = Sampler(mode=backend)\nsampler.options.default_shots = 1024  # Options can be set using auto-complete.\njob = sampler.run([isa_circuit])\nprint(f\"Job ID is {job.job_id()}\")\npub_result = job.result()[0]\nprint(f\"Counts for the meas output register: {pub_result.data.meas.get_counts()}\")\n```\n\n### Estimator\n\nThis primitive takes circuits and observables as input, to evaluate expectation values and standard error for a given parameter input. This Estimator allows users to efficiently calculate and interpret expectation values of quantum operators required for many algorithms.\n\nTo invoke the `Estimator` primitive:\n\n```python\nfrom qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService, EstimatorV2 as Estimator\nfrom qiskit.quantum_info import SparsePauliOp\nfrom qiskit import QuantumCircuit\nfrom qiskit.circuit import Parameter\nimport numpy as np\n\nservice = QiskitRuntimeService()\n\n# 1. A quantum circuit for preparing the quantum state (|000> + e^{itheta} |111>)/rt{2}\ntheta = Parameter('Œ∏')\ncircuit = QuantumCircuit(3)\ncircuit.h(0) # generate superposition\ncircuit.p(theta, 0) # add quantum phase\ncircuit.cx(0, 1) # condition 1st qubit on 0th qubit\ncircuit.cx(0, 2) # condition 2nd qubit on 0th qubit\n\n# The observable to be measured\nM1 = SparsePauliOp.from_list([(\"XXY\", 1), (\"XYX\", 1), (\"YXX\", 1), (\"YYY\", -1)])\n\n# batch of theta parameters to be executed\npoints = 50\ntheta1 = []\nfor x in range(points):\n    theta = [x*2.0*np.pi/50]\n    theta1.append(theta)\n\n# 2: Optimize problem for quantum execution.\nbackend = service.least_busy(operational=True, simulator=False)\npm = generate_preset_pass_manager(backend=backend, optimization_level=1)\nisa_circuit = pm.run(circuit)\nisa_observables = M1.apply_layout(isa_circuit.layout)\n\n# 3. Execute using the Estimator primitive\nestimator = Estimator(backend)\nestimator.options.resilience_level = 1  # Options can be set using auto-complete.\njob = estimator.run([(isa_circuit, isa_observables, theta1)])\nprint(f\"Job ID is {job.job_id()}\")\npub_result = job.result()[0]\nprint(f\"Expectation values: {pub_result.data.evs}\")\n```\n\nThis code batches together 50 parameters to be executed in a single job. If a user wanted to find the `theta` that optimized the observable, they could plot and observe it occurs at `theta=np.pi/2`. For speed we recommend batching results together (note that depending on your access, there may be limits on the number of circuits, objects, and parameters that you can send).\n\n\n## Session\n\nIn many algorithms and applications, an Estimator needs to be called iteratively without incurring queuing delays on each iteration. To solve this, the IBM Runtime service provides a **Session**. A session starts when the first job within the session is started, and subsequent jobs within the session are prioritized by the scheduler.\n\nYou can use the [`qiskit_ibm_runtime.Session`](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/blob/main/qiskit_ibm_runtime/session.py) class to start a\nsession. Consider the same example above and try to find the optimal `theta`. The following example uses the [golden search method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden-section_search) to iteratively find the optimal theta that maximizes the observable.\n\nTo invoke the `Estimator` primitive within a session:\n\n```python\nfrom qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService, Session, EstimatorV2 as Estimator\nfrom qiskit.quantum_info import SparsePauliOp\nfrom qiskit import QuantumCircuit\nfrom qiskit.circuit import Parameter\nimport numpy as np\n\nservice = QiskitRuntimeService()\n\n# 1. A quantum circuit for preparing the quantum state (|000> + e^{itheta} |111>)/rt{2}\ntheta = Parameter('Œ∏')\ncircuit = QuantumCircuit(3)\ncircuit.h(0) # generate superpostion\ncircuit.p(theta,0) # add quantum phase\ncircuit.cx(0, 1) # condition 1st qubit on 0th qubit\ncircuit.cx(0, 2) # condition 2nd qubit on 0th qubit\n\n# The observable to be measured\nM1 = SparsePauliOp.from_list([(\"XXY\", 1), (\"XYX\", 1), (\"YXX\", 1), (\"YYY\", -1)])\n\ngr = (np.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2 # golden ratio\nthetaa = 0 # lower range of theta\nthetab = 2*np.pi # upper range of theta\ntol = 1e-1 # tol\n\n# 2: Optimize problem for quantum execution.\nbackend = service.least_busy(operational=True, simulator=False)\npm = generate_preset_pass_manager(backend=backend, optimization_level=1)\nisa_circuit = pm.run(circuit)\nisa_observables = M1.apply_layout(isa_circuit.layout)\n\n# 3. Execute iteratively using the Estimator primitive\nwith Session(service=service, backend=backend) as session:\n    estimator = Estimator(session=session)\n    estimator.options.default_precision = 0.03  # Options can be set using auto-complete.\n    #next test range\n    thetac = thetab - (thetab - thetaa) / gr\n    thetad = thetaa + (thetab - thetaa) / gr\n    while abs(thetab - thetaa) > tol:\n        print(f\"max value of M1 is in the range theta = {[thetaa, thetab]}\")\n        job = estimator.run([(isa_circuit, isa_observables, [[thetac],[thetad]])])\n        test = job.result()[0].data.evs\n        if test[0] > test[1]:\n            thetab = thetad\n        else:\n            thetaa = thetac\n        thetac = thetab - (thetab - thetaa) / gr\n        thetad = thetaa + (thetab - thetaa) / gr\n\n    # Final job to evaluate Estimator at midpoint found using golden search method\n    theta_mid = (thetab + thetaa) / 2\n    job = estimator.run([(isa_circuit, isa_observables, theta_mid)])\n    print(f\"Session ID is {session.session_id}\")\n    print(f\"Final Job ID is {job.job_id()}\")\n    print(f\"Job result is {job.result()[0].data.evs} at theta = {theta_mid}\")\n```\n\nThis code returns `Job result is [4.] at theta = 1.575674623307102` using only nine iterations. This is a very powerful extension to the primitives. However, using too much code between iterative calls can lock the QPU and use excessive QPU time, which is expensive. We recommend only using sessions when needed. The Sampler can also be used within a session, but there are not any well-defined examples for this.\n\n## Instances\n\nAccess to IBM Quantum Platform channel is controlled by the instances (previously called providers) to which you are assigned. An instance is defined by a hierarchical organization of hub, group, and project. A hub is the top level of a given hierarchy (organization) and contains within it one or more groups. These groups are in turn populated with projects. The combination of hub/group/project is called an instance. Users can belong to more than one instance at any time.\n\n> **_NOTE:_** IBM Cloud instances are different from IBM Quantum Platform instances.  IBM Cloud does not use the hub/group/project structure for user management. To view and create IBM Cloud instances, visit the [IBM Cloud Quantum Instances page](https://cloud.ibm.com/quantum/instances).\n\nTo view a list of your instances, visit your [account settings page](https://www.quantum-computing.ibm.com/account) or use the `instances()` method.\n\nYou can specify an instance when initializing the service or provider, or when picking a backend:\n\n```python\n# Optional: List all the instances you can access.\nservice = QiskitRuntimeService(channel='ibm_quantum')\nprint(service.instances())\n\n# Optional: Specify the instance at service level. This becomes the default unless overwritten.\nservice = QiskitRuntimeService(channel='ibm_quantum', instance=\"hub1/group1/project1\")\nbackend1 = service.backend(\"ibmq_manila\")\n\n# Optional: Specify the instance at the backend level, which overwrites the service-level specification when this backend is used.\nbackend2 = service.backend(\"ibmq_manila\", instance=\"hub2/group2/project2\")\n\nsampler1 = Sampler(mode=backend1)    # this will use hub1/group1/project1\nsampler2 = Sampler(mode=backend2)    # this will use hub2/group2/project2\n```\n\nIf you do not specify an instance, then the code will select one in the following order:\n\n1. If your account only has access to one instance, it is selected by default.\n2. If your account has access to multiple instances, but only one can access the requested backend, the instance with access is selected.\n3. In all other cases, the code selects the first instance other than ibm-q/open/main that has access to the backend.\n\n## Access your IBM Quantum backends\n\nA **backend** is a quantum device or simulator capable of running quantum circuits or pulse schedules.\n\nYou can query for the backends you have access to. Attributes and methods of the returned instances\nprovide information, such as qubit counts, error rates, and statuses, of the backends.\n\n```python\nfrom qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService\nservice = QiskitRuntimeService()\n\n# Display all backends you have access.\nprint(service.backends())\n\n# Get a specific backend.\nbackend = service.backend('ibm_brisbane')\n\n# Print backend coupling map.\nprint(backend.coupling_map)\n```\n\n## Next Steps\n\nNow you're set up and ready to check out some of the [tutorials].\n\n## Contribution guidelines\n\nIf you'd like to contribute to qiskit-ibm-runtime, please take a look at our\n[contribution guidelines].

It integrates seamlessly with ipython notebooks & python/ipython terminals.  Currently this tool supports such Pandas objects as DataFrame, Series, MultiIndex, DatetimeIndex & RangeIndex.\n\n## Origins\n\nD-Tale was the product of a SAS to Python conversion.  What was originally a perl script wrapper on top of SAS's `insight` function is now a lightweight web client on top of Pandas data structures.\n\n## In The News\n\n - [4 Libraries that can perform EDA in one line of python code](https://towardsdatascience.com/4-libraries-that-can-perform-eda-in-one-line-of-python-code-b13938a06ae)\n -

Here is a nice article:\n[How to Allow Apps to Communicate Through the Windows Firewall](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/uncategorized/how-to-create-exceptions-in-windows-vista-firewall/)\n\n#### Additional functions available programmatically\n```python\nimport dtale\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame([dict(a=1,b=2,c=3)])\n\n# Assigning a reference to a running D-Tale process.\nd = dtale.show(df)\n\n# Accessing data associated with D-Tale process.\ntmp = d.data.copy()\ntmp['d'] = 4\n\n# Altering data associated with D-Tale process\n# FYI: this will clear any front-end settings you have at the time for this process (filter, sorts, formatting)\nd.data = tmp\n\n# Get raw dataframe w/ any sorting or edits made through the UI\nd.data\n\n# Get raw dataframe similar to '.data' along with any filters applied using the UI\nd.view_data\n\n# Shutting down D-Tale process\nd.kill()\n\n# Using Python's `webbrowser` package it will try and open your server's default browser to this process.\nd.open_browser()\n\n# There is also some helpful metadata about the process.\nd._data_id  # The process's data identifier.\nd._url  # The url to access the process.\n\nd2 = dtale.get_instance(d._data_id)  # Returns a new reference to the instance running at that data_id.\n\ndtale.instances()  # Prints a list of all ids & urls of running D-Tale sessions.\n\n```\n\n#### Duplicate data check\nTo help guard against users loading the same data to D-Tale multiple times and thus eating up precious memory, we have a loose check for duplicate input data.  The check runs the following:\n * Are row & column count the same as a previously loaded piece of data?\n * Are the names and order of columns the same as a previously loaded piece of data?\n\nIf both these conditions are true then you will be presented with an error and a link to the previously loaded data.  Here is an example of how the interaction looks:\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/Duplicate_data.png)\n\n\n### As A Script\n\nD-Tale can be run as script by adding `subprocess=False` to your `dtale.show` command.  Here is an example script:\n```python\nimport dtale\nimport pandas as pd\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n      dtale.show(pd.DataFrame([1,2,3,4,5]), subprocess=False)\n```\n\n### Jupyter Notebook\nWithin any jupyter (ipython) notebook executing a cell like this will display a small instance of D-Tale in the output cell.  Here are some examples:\n\n|`dtale.show`|assignment|instance|\n|:------:|:------:|:------:|\n|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/ipython1.png)|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/ipython2.png)|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/ipython3.png)|\n\nIf you are running ipython<=5.0 then you also have the ability to adjust the size of your output cell for the most recent instance displayed:\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/ipython_adjust.png)\n\nOne thing of note is that a lot of the modal popups you see in the standard browser version will now open separate browser windows for spacial convienence:\n\n|Column Menus|Correlations|Describe|Column Analysis|Instances|\n|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|\n|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/Column_menu.png)|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/correlations_popup.png)|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/describe_popup.png)|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/histogram_popup.png)|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/instances_popup.png)|\n\n### JupyterHub w/ Jupyter Server Proxy\n\nJupyterHub has an extension that allows to proxy port for user, [JupyterHub Server Proxy](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyter-server-proxy)\n\nTo me it seems like this extension might be the best solution to getting D-Tale running within kubernetes.  Here's how to use it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\nimport dtale\nimport dtale.app as dtale_app\n\ndtale_app.JUPYTER_SERVER_PROXY = True\n\ndtale.show(pd.DataFrame([1,2,3]))\n```\n\nNotice the command `dtale_app.JUPYTER_SERVER_PROXY = True` this will make sure that any D-Tale instance will be served with the jupyter server proxy application root prefix:\n\n`/user/{jupyter username}/proxy/{dtale instance port}/`\n\nOne thing to note is that if you try to look at the `_main_url` of your D-Tale instance in your notebook it will not include the hostname or port:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\nimport dtale\nimport dtale.app as dtale_app\n\ndtale_app.JUPYTER_SERVER_PROXY = True\n\nd = dtale.show(pd.DataFrame([1,2,3]))\nd._main_url # /user/johndoe/proxy/40000/dtale/main/1\n```\n\n This is because it's very hard to promgramatically figure out the host/port that your notebook is running on.  So if you want to look at `_main_url` please be sure to preface it with:\n \n `http[s]://[jupyterhub host]:[jupyterhub port]`\n\nIf for some reason jupyterhub changes their API so that the application root changes you can also override D-Tale's application root by using the `app_root` parameter to the `show()` function:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\nimport dtale\nimport dtale.app as dtale_app\n\ndtale.show(pd.DataFrame([1,2,3]), app_root='/user/johndoe/proxy/40000/`)\n```\n\nUsing this parameter will only apply the application root to that specific instance so you would have to include it on every call to `show()`.\n\n### JupyterHub w/ Kubernetes\n\nPlease read this [post](https://github.com/man-group/dtale/blob/master/docs/JUPYTERHUB_KUBERNETES.md)\n\n### Docker Container\n\nIf you have D-Tale installed within your docker container please add the following parameters to your `docker run` command.\n\n**On a Mac**:\n\n```sh\ndocker run -h `hostname` -p 40000:40000\n```\n\n* `-h` this will allow the hostname (and not the PID of the docker container) to be available when building D-Tale URLs\n* `-p` access to port 40000 which is the default port for running D-Tale\n\n**On Windows**:\n\n```sh\ndocker run -p 40000:40000\n```\n\n* `-p` access to port 40000 which is the default port for running D-Tale\n* D-Tale URL will be http://127.0.0.1:40000/\n\n**Everything Else**:\n\n```sh\ndocker run -h `hostname` --network host\n```\n\n* `-h` this will allow the hostname (and not the PID of the docker container) to be available when building D-Tale URLs\n* `--network host` this will allow access to as many ports as needed for running D-Tale processes\n\n### Google Colab\n\nThis is a hosted notebook site and thanks to Colab's internal function `google.colab.output.eval_js` & the JS function `google.colab.kernel.proexyPort` users can run D-Tale within their notebooks.\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** It is important that you set `USE_COLAB` to true when using D-Tale within this service.  Here is an example:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\nimport dtale\nimport dtale.app as dtale_app\n\ndtale_app.USE_COLAB = True\n\ndtale.show(pd.DataFrame([1,2,3]))\n```\n\nIf this does not work for you try using `USE_NGROK` which is described in the next section.\n\n### Kaggle\n\nThis is yet another hosted notebook site and thanks to the work of [flask_ngrok](https://github.com/gstaff/flask-ngrok) users can run D-Tale within their notebooks.\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** It is import that you set `USE_NGROK` to true when using D-Tale within this service.  Please make sure to run `pip install flask-ngrok` before running this example. Here is an example:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\nimport dtale\nimport dtale.app as dtale_app\n\ndtale_app.USE_NGROK = True\n\ndtale.show(pd.DataFrame([1,2,3]))\n```\n\nHere are some video tutorials of each:\n\n|Service|Tutorial|Addtl Notes|\n|:------:|:------:|:------:|\n|Google Colab|[![](http://img.youtube.com/vi/pOYl2M1clIw/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOYl2M1clIw \"Google Colab\")||\n|Kaggle|[![](http://img.youtube.com/vi/8Il-2HHs2Mg/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Il-2HHs2Mg \"Kaggle\")|make sure you switch the \"Internet\" toggle to \"On\" under settings of your notebook so you can install the egg from pip|\n\nIt is important to note that using NGROK will limit you to 20 connections per mintue so if you see this error:\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/ngrok_limit.png)\n\nWait a little while and it should allow you to do work again.  I am actively working on finding a more sustainable solution similar to what I did for google colab. :pray:\n\n### Binder\n\nI have built a repo which shows an example of how to run D-Tale within Binder [here](https://github.com/aschonfeld/dtale-binder).\n\nThe important take-aways are:\n* you must have `jupyter-server-proxy` installed\n* look at the `environment.yml` file to see how to add it to your environment\n* look at the `postBuild` file for how to activate it on startup\n\n\n### R with Reticulate\n\nI was able to get D-Tale running in R using reticulate. Here is an example:\n\n```\nlibrary('reticulate')\ndtale <- import('dtale')\ndf <- read.csv('https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/boot/acme.csv')\ndtale$show(df, subprocess=FALSE, open_browser=TRUE)\n```\n\nNow the problem with doing this is that D-Tale is not running as a subprocess so it will block your R console and you'll lose out the following functions:\n - manipulating the state of your data from your R console\n - adding more data to D-Tale\n\n`open_browser=TRUE` isn't required and won't work if you don't have a default browser installed on your machine. If you don't use that parameter simply copy & paste the URL that gets printed to your console in the browser of your choice.\n\nI'm going to do some more digging on why R doesn't seem to like using python subprocesses (not sure if it something with how reticulate manages the state of python) and post any findings to this thread.\n\nHere's some helpful links for getting setup:\n\nreticulate\n\ninstalling python packages\n\n### Startup with No Data\n\nIt is now possible to run D-Tale with no data loaded up front. So simply call `dtale.show()` and this will start the application for you and when you go to view it you will be presented with a screen where you can upload either a CSV or TSV file for data.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/no_data.png)\n\nOnce you've loaded a file it will take you directly to the standard data grid comprised of the data from the file you loaded.  This might make it easier to use this as an on demand application within a container management system like kubernetes. You start and stop these on demand and you'll be presented with a new instance to load any CSV or TSV file to!\n\n### Command-line\nBase CLI options (run `dtale --help` to see all options available)\n\n|Prop     |Description|\n|:--------|:-----------|\n|`--host` |the name of the host you would like to use (most likely not needed since `socket.gethostname()` should figure this out)|\n|`--port` |the port you would like to assign to your D-Tale instance|\n|`--name` |an optional name you can assign to your D-Tale instance (this will be displayed in the `<title>` & Instances popup)|\n|`--debug`|turn on Flask's \"debug\" mode for your D-Tale instance|\n|`--no-reaper`|flag to turn off auto-reaping subprocess (kill D-Tale instances after an hour of inactivity), good for long-running displays |\n|`--open-browser`|flag to automatically open up your server's default browser to your D-Tale instance|\n|`--force`|flag to force D-Tale to try an kill any pre-existing process at the port you've specified so it can use it|\n\nLoading data from [**ArcticDB**(high performance, serverless DataFrame database)](https://github.com/man-group/ArcticDB) (this requires either installing **arcticdb** or **dtale[arcticdb]**)\n```bash\ndtale --arcticdb-uri lmdb:///<path> --arcticdb-library jdoe.my_lib --arcticdb-symbol my_symbol\n```\nIf you would like to change your storage mechanism to ArcticDB then add the `--arcticdb-use_store` flag\n```bash\ndtale --arcticdb-uri lmdb:///<path> --arcticdb-library my_lib --arcticdb-symbol my_symbol --arcticdb-use_store\n```\nLoading data from [**arctic**(high performance datastore for pandas dataframes)](https://github.com/man-group/arctic) (this requires either installing **arctic** or **dtale[arctic]**)\n```bash\ndtale --arctic-uri mongodb://localhost:27027 --arctic-library my_lib --arctic-symbol my_symbol --arctic-start 20130101 --arctic-end 20161231\n```\nLoading data from **CSV**\n```bash\ndtale --csv-path /home/jdoe/my_csv.csv --csv-parse_dates date\n```\nLoading data from **EXCEL**\n```bash\ndtale --excel-path /home/jdoe/my_csv.xlsx --excel-parse_dates date\ndtale --excel-path /home/jdoe/my_csv.xls --excel-parse_dates date\n```\nLoading data from **JSON**\n```bash\ndtale --json-path /home/jdoe/my_json.json --json-parse_dates date\n```\nor\n```bash\ndtale --json-path http://json-endpoint --json-parse_dates date\n```\nLoading data from **R Datasets**\n```bash\ndtale --r-path /home/jdoe/my_dataset.rda\n```\nLoading data from **SQLite DB Files**\n```bash\ndtale --sqlite-path /home/jdoe/test.sqlite3 --sqlite-table test_table\n```\n\n### Custom Command-line Loaders\n\nLoading data from a **Custom** loader\n- Using the DTALE_CLI_LOADERS environment variable, specify a path to a location containing some python modules\n- Any python module containing the global variables LOADER_KEY & LOADER_PROPS will be picked up as a custom loader\n  - LOADER_KEY: the key that will be associated with your loader.  By default you are given **arctic** & **csv** (if you use one of these are your key it will override these)\n  - LOADER_PROPS: the individual props available to be specified.\n    - For example, with arctic we have host, library, symbol, start & end.\n    - If you leave this property as an empty list your loader will be treated as a flag.  For example, instead of using all the arctic properties we would simply specify `--arctic` (this wouldn't work well in arctic's case since it depends on all those properties)\n- You will also need to specify a function with the following signature `def find_loader(kwargs)` which returns a function that returns a dataframe or `None`\n- Here is an example of a custom loader:\n```python\nfrom dtale.cli.clickutils import get_loader_options\n\n'''\n  IMPORTANT!!! This global variable is required for building any customized CLI loader.\n  When find loaders on startup it will search for any modules containing the global variable LOADER_KEY.\n'''\nLOADER_KEY = 'testdata'\nLOADER_PROPS = ['rows', 'columns']\n\n\ndef test_data(rows, columns):\n    import pandas as pd\n    import numpy as np\n    import random\n    from past.utils import old_div\n    from pandas.tseries.offsets import Day\n    from dtale.utils import dict_merge\n    import string\n\n    now = pd.Timestamp(pd.Timestamp('now').date())\n    dates = pd.date_range(now - Day(364), now)\n    num_of_securities = max(old_div(rows, len(dates)), 1)  # always have at least one security\n    securities = [\n        dict(security_id=100000 + sec_id, int_val=random.randint(1, 100000000000),\n             str_val=random.choice(string.ascii_letters) * 5)\n        for sec_id in range(num_of_securities)\n    ]\n    data = pd.concat([\n        pd.DataFrame([dict_merge(dict(date=date), sd) for sd in securities])\n        for date in dates\n    ], ignore_index=True)[['date', 'security_id', 'int_val', 'str_val']]\n\n    col_names = ['Col{}'.format(c) for c in range(columns)]\n    return pd.concat([data, pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(len(data), columns), columns=col_names)], axis=1)\n\n\n# IMPORTANT!!! This function is required for building any customized CLI loader.\ndef find_loader(kwargs):\n    test_data_opts = get_loader_options(LOADER_KEY, LOADER_PROPS, kwargs)\n    if len([f for f in test_data_opts.values() if f]):\n        def _testdata_loader():\n            return test_data(int(test_data_opts.get('rows', 1000500)), int(test_data_opts.get('columns', 96)))\n\n        return _testdata_loader\n    return None\n```\nIn this example we simplying building a dataframe with some dummy data based on dimensions specified on the command-line:\n- `--testdata-rows`\n- `--testdata-columns`\n\nHere's how you would use this loader:\n```bash\nDTALE_CLI_LOADERS=./path_to_loaders bash -c 'dtale --testdata-rows 10 --testdata-columns 5'\n```\n\n### Authentication\n\nYou can choose to use optional authentication by adding the following to your D-Tale `.ini` file ([directions here](https://github.com/man-group/dtale/blob/master/docs/CONFIGURATION.md)):\n\n```ini\n[auth]\nactive = True\nusername = johndoe\npassword = 1337h4xOr\n```\n\nOr you can call the following:\n\n```python\nimport dtale.global_state as global_state\n\nglobal_state.set_auth_settings({'active': True, 'username': 'johndoe', 'password': '1337h4x0r'})\n```\n\nIf you have done this before initially starting D-Tale it will have authentication applied.  If you are adding this after starting D-Tale you will have to kill your service and start it over.\n\nWhen opening your D-Tale session you will be presented with a screen like this:\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/login.png)\n\nFrom there you can enter the credentials you either set in your `.ini` file or in your call to `dtale.global_state.set_auth_settings` and you will be brought to the main grid as normal.  You will now have an additional option in your main menu to logout:\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/logout.png)\n\n### Instance Settings\n\nUsers can set front-end properties on their instances programmatically in the `dtale.show` function or by calling the `update_settings` function on their instance.  For example:\n\n```python\nimport dtale\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(dict(\n  a=[1,2,3,4,5],\n  b=[6,7,8,9,10],\n  c=['a','b','c','d','e']\n))\ndtale.show(\n  df,\n  locked=['c'],\n  column_formats={'a': {'fmt': '0.0000'}},\n  nan_display='...',\n  background_mode='heatmap-col',\n  sort=[('a','DESC')],\n  vertical_headers=True,\n)\n```\n\nor\n\n```python\nimport dtale\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(dict(\n  a=[1,2,3,4,5],\n  b=[6,7,8,9,10],\n  c=['a','b','c','d','e']\n))\nd = dtale.show(\n  df\n)\nd.update_settings(\n  locked=['c'],\n  column_formats={'a': {'fmt': '0.0000'}},\n  nan_display='...',\n  background_mode='heatmap-col',\n  sort=[('a','DESC')],\n  vertical_headers=True,\n)\nd\n```\n\nHere's a short description of each instance setting available:\n\n#### show_columns\nA list of column names you would like displayed in your grid. Anything else will be hidden.\n\n#### hide_columns\nA list of column names you would like initially hidden from the grid display.\n\n#### column_formats\nA dictionary of column name keys and their front-end display configuration. Here are examples of the different format configurations:\n* Numeric: `{'fmt': '0.00000'}`\n* String:\n  * `{'fmt': {'truncate': 10}}` truncate string values to no more than 10 characters followed by an ellipses \n  * `{'fmt': {'link': True}}` if your strings are URLs convert them to clickable links\n  * `{'fmt': {'html': True}}` if your strings are HTML fragments render them as HTML\n* Date: `{'fmt': 'MMMM Do YYYY, h:mm:ss a'}` uses [Moment.js formatting](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/)\n\n#### nan_display\nConverts any `nan` values in your dataframe to this when it is sent to the browser (doesn't actually change the state of your dataframe)\n\n#### sort\nList of tuples which sort your dataframe (EX: `[('a', 'ASC'), ('b', 'DESC')]`)\n\n#### locked\nList of column names which will be locked to the right side of your grid while you scroll to the left.\n\n#### background_mode\nA string denoting one of the many background displays available in D-Tale. Options are:\n* heatmap-all: turn on heatmap for all numeric columns where the colors are determined by the range of values over all numeric columns combined\n* heatmap-col: turn on heatmap for all numeric columns where the colors are determined by the range of values in the column\n* heatmap-col-[column name]: turn on heatmap highlighting for a specific column\n* dtypes: highlight columns based on it's data type\n* missing: highlight any missing values (np.nan, empty strings, strings of all spaces)\n* outliers: highlight any outliers\n* range: highlight values for any matchers entered in the \"range_highlights\" option\n* lowVariance: highlight values with a low variance\n\n#### range_highlights\nDictionary of column name keys and range configurations which if the value for that column exists then it will be shaded that color.  Here is an example input:\n```\n'a': {\n  'active': True,\n  'equals': {'active': True, 'value': 3, 'color': {'r': 255, 'g': 245, 'b': 157, 'a': 1}}, # light yellow\n  'greaterThan': {'active': True, 'value': 3, 'color': {'r': 80, 'g': 227, 'b': 194, 'a': 1}}, # mint green\n  'lessThan': {'active': True, 'value': 3, 'color': {'r': 245, 'g': 166, 'b': 35, 'a': 1}}, # orange\n}\n```\n\n#### vertical_headers\nIf set to `True` then the headers in your grid will be rotated 90 degrees vertically to conserve width.\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/vertical_headers.png)\n\n\n### Predefined Filters\n\nUsers can build their own custom filters which can be used from the front-end using the following code snippet:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport dtale\nimport dtale.predefined_filters as predefined_filters\nimport dtale.global_state as global_state\n\nglobal_state.set_app_settings(dict(open_predefined_filters_on_startup=True))\n\npredefined_filters.set_filters([\n    {\n        \"name\": \"A and B > 2\",\n        \"column\": \"A\",\n        \"description\": \"Filter A with B greater than 2\",\n        \"handler\": lambda df, val: df[(df[\"A\"] == val) & (df[\"B\"] > 2)],\n        \"input_type\": \"input\",\n        \"default\": 1,\n        \"active\": False,\n    },\n    {\n        \"name\": \"A and (B % 2) == 0\",\n        \"column\": \"A\",\n        \"description\": \"Filter A with B mod 2 equals zero (is even)\",\n        \"handler\": lambda df, val: df[(df[\"A\"] == val) & (df[\"B\"] % 2 == 0)],\n        \"input_type\": \"select\",\n        \"default\": 1,\n        \"active\": False,\n    },\n    {\n        \"name\": \"A in values and (B % 2) == 0\",\n        \"column\": \"A\",\n        \"description\": \"A is within a group of values and B mod 2 equals zero (is even)\",\n        \"handler\": lambda df, val: df[df[\"A\"].isin(val) & (df[\"B\"] % 2 == 0)],\n        \"input_type\": \"multiselect\",\n        \"default\": [1],\n        \"active\": True,\n    }\n])\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(\n    ([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]]),\n    columns=['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']\n)\ndtale.show(df)\n```\n\nThis code illustrates the types of inputs you can have on the front end:\n* __input__: just a simple text input box which users can enter any value they want (if the value specified for `\"column\"` is an int or float it will try to convert the string to that data type) and it will be passed to the handler\n* __select__: this creates a dropdown populated with the unique values of `\"column\"` (an asynchronous dropdown if the column has a large amount of unique values)\n* __multiselect__: same as \"select\" but it will allow you to choose multiple values (handy if you want to perform an `isin` operation in your filter)\n\nHere is a demo of the functionality:\n[![](http://img.youtube.com/vi/8mryVxpxjM4/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mryVxpxjM4 \"Predefined Filters\")\n\nIf there are any new types of inputs you would like available please don't hesitate to submit a request on the \"Issues\" page of the repo.\n\n### Using Swifter\n\nSwifter is a package which will increase performance on any `apply()` function on a pandas series or dataframe.  If install the package in your virtual environment\n```sh\npip install swifter\n# or\npip install dtale[swifter]\n```\n\nIt will be used for the following operations:\n- Standard dataframe formatting in the main grid & chart display\n- Column Builders\n  - Type Conversions\n    - string hex -> int or float\n    - int or float -> hex\n    - mixed -> boolean\n    - int -> timestamp\n    - date -> int\n  - Similarity Distance Calculation\n- Handling of empty strings when calculating missing counts\n- Building unique values by data type in \"Describe\" popup\n\n\n### Behavior for Wide Dataframes\n\nThere is currently a performance bottleneck on the front-end when loading \"wide dataframes\" (dataframes with many columns). The current solution to this problem is that upon initial load of these dataframes to D-Tale any column with an index greater than 100 (going from left to right) will be hidden on the front-end.  You can still unhide these columns the same way you would any other and you still have the option to show all columns using the \"Describe\" popup. Here's a sample of this behavior:\n\nSay you loaded this dataframe into D-Tale.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport dtale\n\ndtale.show(pd.DataFrame(\n    {'col{}'.format(i): list(range(1000)) for i in range(105)}\n))\n```\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/wide_dataframes/initial_load.png)\n\nYou will now have access to a new \"Jump To Column\" menu item.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/wide_dataframes/jump_to_col_menu_item.png)\n\nIt would be too hard to scroll to the column you're looking for. So now you'll be able to type in the name of the column you're looking for and select it.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/wide_dataframes/jump_to_col_popup.png)\n\nAnd now you'll see only the columns you've had locked (we've locked no columns in this example) and the column you chose to jump to.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/wide_dataframes/jump_to_col_done.png)\n\n### Accessing CLI Loaders in Notebook or Console\nI am pleased to announce that all CLI loaders will be available within notebooks & consoles.  Here are some examples (the last working if you've installed `dtale[arctic]`):\n- `dtale.show_csv(path='test.csv', parse_dates=['date'])`\n- `dtale.show_csv(path='http://csv-endpoint', index_col=0)`\n- `dtale.show_excel(path='test.xlsx', parse_dates=['date'])`\n- `dtale.show_excel(path='test.xls', sheet=)`\n- `dtale.show_excel(path='http://excel-endpoint', index_col=0)`\n- `dtale.show_json(path='http://json-endpoint', parse_dates=['date'])`\n- `dtale.show_json(path='test.json', parse_dates=['date'])`\n- `dtale.show_r(path='text.rda')`\n- `dtale.show_arctic(uri='uri', library='library', symbol='symbol', start='20200101', end='20200101')`\n- `dtale.show_arcticdb(uri='uri', library='library', symbol='symbol', start='20200101', end='20200101', use_store=True)`\n\n### Using ArcticDB as your data store for D-Tale\nSo one of the major drawbacks of using D-Tale is that it stores a copy of your dataframe in memory (unless you specify the `inplace=True` when calling `dtale.show`). One way around this is to switch your storage mechanism to ArcticDB. This will use ArcticDB's [QueryBuilder](https://docs.arcticdb.io/api/query_builder) to perform all data loading and filtering.  This will significantly drop your memory footprint, but it will remove a lot of the original D-Tale functionality:\n- Custom Filtering\n- Range filtering in Numeric Column Filters\n- Regex filtering on String Column Filters\n- Editing Cells\n- Data Reshaping\n- Dataframe Functions\n- Drop Filtered Rows\n- Sorting\n\nIf the symbol you're loading from ArcticDB contains more than 1,000,000 rows then you will also lose the following:\n- Column Filtering using dropdowns of unique values (you'll have to manually type your values)\n- Outlier Highlighting\n- Most of the details in the \"Describe\" screen\n\nIn order to update your storage mechanism there are a few options, the first being `use_arcticdb_store`:\n```python\nimport dtale.global_state as global_state\nimport dtale\n\nglobal_state.use_arcticdb_store(uri='lmdb:///<path>')\ndtale.show_arcticdb(library='my_lib', symbol='my_symbol')\n```\n\nOr you can set your library ahead of time so you can use `dtale.show`:\n```python\nimport dtale.global_state as global_state\nimport dtale\n\nglobal_state.use_arcticdb_store(uri='lmdb:///<path>', library='my_lib')\ndtale.show('my_symbol')\n```\n\nOr you can set your library using `dtale.show` with a pipe-delimited identifier:\n```python\nimport dtale.global_state as global_state\nimport dtale\n\nglobal_state.use_arcticdb_store(uri='lmdb:///<path>')\ndtale.show('my_lib|my_symbol')\n```\n\nYou can also do everything using `dtale.show_arcticdb`:\n```python\nimport dtale\n\ndtale.show_arcticdb(uri='lmdb:///<path>', library='my_lib', symbol='my_symbol', use_store=True)\n```\n\n### Navigating to different libraries/symbols in your ArcticDB database\n\nWhen starting D-Tale with no data\n```python\nimport dtale.global_state as global_state\nimport dtale\n\nglobal_state.use_arcticdb_store(uri='lmdb:///<path>')\ndtale.show()\n```\n\nyou'll be presented with this screen on startup\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/arcticdb/select_library_and_symbol.png)\n\nOnce you choose a library and a symbol you can click \"Load\" and it will bring you to the main grid comprised of the data for that symbol.\n\nYou can also view information about the symbol you've selected before loading it by clicking the \"Info\" button\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/arcticdb/description.png)\n\n## UI\nOnce you have kicked off your D-Tale session please copy & paste the link on the last line of output in your browser\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/Browser1.png)\n\n### Dimensions/Ribbon Menu/Main Menu\nThe information in the upper right-hand corner gives grid dimensions ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/Info_cell.png)\n- lower-left => row count\n- upper-right => column count\n\nRibbon Menu\n- hovering around to top of your browser will display a menu items (similar to the ones in the main menu) across the top of the screen\n- to close the menu simply click outside the menu and/or dropdowns from the menu\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/Ribbon_menu.png)\n\nMain Menu\n- clicking the triangle displays the menu of standard functions (click outside menu to close it)\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/Info_menu_small.png)\n\n### Header\n\nThe header gives users an idea of what operations have taken place on your data (sorts, filters, hidden columns).  These values will be persisted across broswer instances.  So if you perform one of these operations and then send a link to one of your colleagues they will see the same thing :)\n\nNotice the \"X\" icon on the right of each display.  Clicking this will remove those operations.\n\nWhen performing multiple of the same operation the description will become too large to display so the display will truncate the description and if users click it they will be presented with a tooltip where you can crop individual operations.  Here are some examples:\n\n|Sorts|Filters|Hidden Columns|\n|-----|-------|--------------|\n|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/header/sorts.PNG)|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/header/filters.PNG)|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/header/hidden.PNG)|\n\n### Resize Columns\n\nCurrently there are two ways which you can resize columns.\n* Dragging the right border of the column's header cell.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/gifs/resize_columns_w_drag.gif)\n\n* Altering the \"Maximum Column Width\" property from the ribbon menu.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/gifs/resize_columns_max_width.gif)\n\n* __Side Note:__ You can also set the `max_column_width` property ahead of time in your [global configuration](https://github.com/man-group/dtale/blob/master/docs/CONFIGURATION.md) or programmatically using:\n\n```python\nimport dtale.global_state as global_state\n\nglobal_state.set_app_settings(dict(max_column_width=100))\n```\n\n### Editing Cells\n\nYou may edit any cells in your grid (with the exception of the row indexes or headers, the ladder can be edited using the [Rename](#rename) column menu function).\n\nIn order to edit a cell simply double-click on it.  This will convert it into a text-input field and you should see a blinking cursor.  In addition to turning that cell into an input it will also display an input at the top of the screen for better viewing of long strings. It is assumed that the value you type in will match the data type of the column you editing.  For example:\n\n* integers -> should be a valid positive or negative integer\n* float -> should be a valid positive or negative float\n* string -> any valid string will do\n* category -> either a pre-existing category or this will create a new category for (so beware!)\n* date, timestamp, timedelta -> should be valid string versions of each\n* boolean -> any string you input will be converted to lowercase and if it equals \"true\" then it will make the cell `True`, otherwise `False`\n\nUsers can make use of two protected values as well:\n\n* \"nan\" -> `numpy.nan`\n* \"inf\" -> `numpy.inf`\n\nTo save your change simply press \"Enter\" or to cancel your changes press \"Esc\".\n\nIf there is a conversion issue with the value you have entered it will display a popup with the specific exception in question.\n\nHere's a quick demo:\n\n[![](http://img.youtube.com/vi/MY5w0m_4IAc/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY5w0m_4IAc \"Editing Long String Cells\")\n\nHere's a demo of editing cells with long strings:\n\n[![](http://img.youtube.com/vi/3p9ltzdBaDQ/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3p9ltzdBaDQ \"Editing Cells\")\n\n\n### Copy Cells Into Clipboard\n\n|Select|Copy|Paste|\n|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|\n|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/select_range1.png)|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/select_range2.png)|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/select_range3.png)|\n\nOne request that I have heard time and time again while working on D-Tale is \"it would be great to be able to copy a range of cells into excel\".  Well here is how that is accomplished:\n1) Shift + Click on a cell\n2) Shift + Click on another cell (this will trigger a popup)\n3) Choose whether you want to include headers in your copy by clicking the checkbox\n4) Click Yes\n5) Go to your excel workbook and execute Ctrl + V or manually choose \"Paste\"\n  * You can also paste this into a standard text editor and what you're left with is tab-delimited data\n\n\n### Main Menu Functions\n\n#### XArray Operations\n\n* **Convert To XArray**: If you have are currently viewing a pandas dataframe in D-Tale you will be given this option to convert your data to an `xarray.Dataset`.  It is as simple as selecting one or many columns as an index and then your dataframe will be converted to a dataset (`df.set_index([...]).to_xarray()`) which makes toggling between indexes slices much easier.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/xarray_indexes.png)\n\n* **XArray Dimensions**: If you are currently viewing data associated with an `xarray.Dataset` you will be given the ability to toggle which dimension coordinates you're viewing by clicking this button.  You can select values for all, some or none (all data - no filter) of your coordinates and the data displayed in your grid will match your selections.  Under the hood the code being executed is as follows: `ds.sel(dim1=coord1,...).to_dataframe()`\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/xarray_dimensions.png)\n\n#### Describe\nView all the columns & their data types as well as individual details of each column\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/Describe.png)\n\n|Data Type|Display|Notes|\n|--------|:------:|:------:|\n|date|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/Describe_date.png)||\n|string|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/Describe_string.png)|If you have less than or equal to 100 unique values they will be displayed at the bottom of your popup|\n|int|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/Describe_int.png)|Anything with standard numeric classifications (min, max, 25%, 50%, 75%) will have a nice boxplot with the mean (if it exists) displayed as an outlier if you look closely.|\n|float|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/Describe_float.png)||\n\n#### Outlier Detection\nWhen viewing integer & float columns in the [\"Describe\" popup](#describe) you will see in the lower right-hand corner a toggle for Uniques & Outliers.\n\n|Outliers|Filter|\n|--------|------|\n|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/outliers.png)|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/outlier_filter.png)|\n\nIf you click the \"Outliers\" toggle this will load the top 100 outliers in your column based on the following code snippet:\n```python\ns = df[column]\nq1 = s.quantile(0.25)\nq3 = s.quantile(0.75)\niqr = q3 - q1\niqr_lower = q1 - 1.5 * iqr\niqr_upper = q3 + 1.5 * iqr\noutliers = s[(s < iqr_lower) | (s > iqr_upper)]\n```\nIf you click on the \"Apply outlier filter\" link this will add an addtional \"outlier\" filter for this column which can be removed from the [header](#header) or the [custom filter](#custom-filter) shown in picture above to the right.\n\n#### Custom Filter\n\n**Starting with version 3.7.0 this feature will be turned off by default.\nCustom filters are vulnerable to code injection attacks, please only use in trusted environments.**\n\n**You can turn this feature on by doing one of the following:**\n - **add `enable_custom_filters=True` to your `dtale.show` call**\n - **add `enable_custom_filters = True` to the [app] section of your dtale.ini config file ([more info](https://github.com/man-group/dtale/blob/master/docs/CONFIGURATION.md))**\n - **run this code before calling dtale.show:**\n```python\nimport dtale.global_state as global_state\nglobal_state.set_app_settings(dict(enable_custom_filters=True))\n```\n\n\nApply a custom pandas `query` to your data (link to pandas documentation included in popup)  \n\n|Editing|Result|\n|--------|:------:|\n|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/Filter_apply.png)|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/Post_filter.png)|\n\nYou can also see any outlier or column filters you've applied (which will be included in addition to your custom query) and remove them if you'd like.\n\nContext Variables are user-defined values passed in via the `context_variables` argument to dtale.show(); they can be referenced in filters by prefixing the variable name with '@'.\n\nFor example, here is how you can use context variables in a pandas query:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame([\n  dict(name='Joe', age=7),\n  dict(name='Bob', age=23),\n  dict(name='Ann', age=45),\n  dict(name='Cat', age=88),\n])\ntwo_oldest_ages = df['age'].nlargest(2)\ndf.query('age in @two_oldest_ages')\n```\nAnd here is how you would pass that context variable to D-Tale: `dtale.show(df, context_variables=dict(two_oldest_ages=two_oldest_ages))`\n\nHere's some nice documentation on the performance of [pandas queries](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/enhancingperf.html#pandas-eval-performance)\n\n#### Dataframe Functions\n\n[![](http://img.youtube.com/vi/G6wNS9-lG04/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6wNS9-lG04 \"Dataframe Functions in D-Tale\")\n\nThis video shows you how to build the following:\n - Numeric: adding/subtracting two columns or columns with static values\n - Bins: bucketing values using pandas cut & qcut as well as assigning custom labels\n - Dates: retrieving date properties (hour, weekday, month...) as well as conversions (month end)\n - Random: columns of data type (int, float, string & date) populated with random uniformly distributed values.\n  - Type Conversion: switch columns from one data type to another, fun. :smile:\n\n\n#### Merge & Stack\n\n[![](http://img.youtube.com/vi/ignDS6OaGVQ/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ignDS6OaGVQ \"Merge & Stack\")\n\nThis feature allows users to merge or stack (vertically concatenate) dataframes they have loaded into D-Tale.  They can also upload additional data to D-Tale while wihin this feature.  The demo shown above goes over the following actions:\n- Editing of parameters to either a pandas merge or stack (vertical concatenation) of dataframes\n  - Viewing direct examples of each from the pandas documentation\n- Selection of dataframes\n- Uploading of additional dataframes from an excel file\n- Viewing code & resulting data from a merge or stack\n\n#### Summarize Data\n\nThis is very powerful functionality which allows users to create a new data from currently loaded data.  The operations currently available are:\n- **Aggregation**: consolidate data by running different aggregations on columns by a specific index\n- **Pivot**: this is simple wrapper around [pandas.Dataframe.pivot](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.pivot.html) and [pandas.pivot_table](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.pivot_table.html)\n- **Transpose**: transpose your data on a index (be careful dataframes can get very wide if your index has many unique values)\n\n|Function|Data|\n|:------:|:------:|\n|No Reshaping|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/reshape/original_data.png)|\n|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/reshape/agg_col.png)|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/reshape/agg_col_data.png)|\n|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/reshape/agg_func.png)|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/reshape/agg_func_data.png)|\n|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/reshape/pivot.png)|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/reshape/pivot_data.png)|\n|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/reshape/transpose.png)|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/reshape/transpose_data.png)|\n\n[![](http://img.youtube.com/vi/fYsxogXKZ2c/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYsxogXKZ2c \"Reshaping Tutorial\")\n\n#### Duplicates\nRemove duplicate columns/values from your data as well as extract duplicates out into separate instances.\n\nThe folowing screen shots are for a dataframe with the following data:\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/duplicates/data.png)\n\n|Function|Description|Preview|\n|:------:|:---------:|:-----:|\n|**Remove Duplicate Columns**|Remove any columns that contain the same data as another and you can either keep the first, last or none of these columns that match this criteria.

You can also open them in a tab by themselves or export them to a static PNG using the links in the upper right corner. You can also close the side panel using the ESC key.\n\n\n| Chart        | Sample |\n|--------------|--------|\n| Matrix     | ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/missingno/matrix.png)|\n| Bar        | ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/missingno/bar.png)|\n| Heatmap    | ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/missingno/heatmap.png)|\n| Dendrogram | ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/missingno/dendrogram.png)|\n\n#### Charts\nBuild custom charts based off your data(powered by [plotly/dash](https://github.com/plotly/dash)).\n \n - The Charts will open in a tab because of the fact there is so much functionality offered there you'll probably want to be able to reference the main grid data in the original tab\n - To build a chart you must pick a value for X & Y inputs which effectively drive what data is along the X & Y axes\n   - If you are working with a 3-Dimensional chart (heatmap, 3D Scatter, Surface) you'll need to enter a value for the Z axis as well\n - Once you have entered all the required axes a chart will be built\n - If your data along the x-axis (or combination of x & y in the case of 3D charts) has duplicates you have three options:\n   - Specify a group, which will create series for each group\n   - Specify an aggregation, you can choose from one of the following: Count, First, Last, Mean, Median, Minimum, Maximum, Standard Deviation, Variance, Mean Absolute Deviation, Product of All Items, Sum, Rolling\n     - Specifying a \"Rolling\" aggregation will also require a Window & a Computation (Correlation, Count, Covariance, Kurtosis, Maximum, Mean, Median, Minimum, Skew, Standard Deviation, Sum or Variance)\n     - For heatmaps you will also have access to the \"Correlation\" aggregation since viewing correlation matrices in heatmaps is very useful.  This aggregation is not supported elsewhere\n   - Specify both a group & an aggregation\n - You now have the ability to toggle between different chart types: line, bar, pie, wordcloud, heatmap, 3D scatter & surface\n - If you have specified a group then you have the ability between showing all series in one chart and breaking each series out into its own chart \"Chart per Group\"\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n|Chart Type|Chart|Chart per Group|\n|:------:|:------:|:------:|\n|line|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/charts/line.png)|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/charts/line_pg.png)|\n|bar|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/charts/bar.png)|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/charts/bar_pg.png)|\n|stacked|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/charts/stacked.png)|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/charts/stacked_pg.png)|\n|pie|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/charts/pie.png)||\n|wordcloud|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/charts/wordcloud.png)|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/charts/wordcloud_pg.png)|\n|heatmap|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/charts/heatmap.png)||\n|3D scatter|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/charts/3d_scatter.png)||\n|surface|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/charts/surface.png)||\n|Maps (Scatter GEO)|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/charts/scattergeo.png)||\n|Maps (Choropleth)|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/charts/choropleth.png)||\n\nY-Axis Toggling\n\nUsers now have the ability to toggle between 3 different behaviors for their y-axis display:\n- *Default*: selecting this option will use the default behavior that comes with plotly for your chart's y-axis\n- *Single*: this allows users to set the range of all series in your chart to be on the same basis as well as making that basis (min/max) editable\n- *Multi*: this allows users to give each series its own y-axis and making that axis' range editable\n\nHere's a quick tutorial: [![](http://img.youtube.com/vi/asblF-rAACY/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asblF-rAACY \"Y-Axis Toggling\")\n\nAnd some screenshots:\n\n|Default|Single|Multi|\n|:------:|:------:|:------:|\n|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/axis_toggle/default.PNG)|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/axis_toggle/single.PNG)|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/axis_toggle/multi.PNG)|\n\nWith a bar chart that only has a single Y-Axis you have the ability to sort the bars based on the values for the Y-Axis\n\n|Pre-sort|Post-sort|\n|:------:|:------:|\n|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/charts/bar_presort.png)|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/charts/bar_postsort.png)|\n\n**Popup Charts**\n\nViewing multiple charts at once and want to separate one out into its own window or simply move one off to the side so you can work on building another for comparison?  Well now you can by clicking the \"Popup\" button :smile:\n\n**Copy Link**\n\nWant to send what you're looking at to someone else?  Simply click the \"Copy Link\" button and it will save a pre-populated chart URL into your clipboard. As long as your D-Tale process is still running when that link is opened you will see your original chart.\n\n**Exporting Charts**\n\nYou can now export your dash charts (with the exception of Wordclouds) to static HTML files which can be emailed to others or saved down to be viewed at a later time.  The best part is that all of the javascript for plotly is embedded in these files so the nice zooming, panning, etc is still available! :boom:\n\n**Exporting CSV**\n\nI've been asked about being able to export the data that is contained within your chart to a CSV for further analysis in tools like Excel.  This button makes that possible.\n\n### OFFLINE CHARTS\n\nWant to run D-Tale in a jupyter notebook and build a chart that will still be displayed even after your D-Tale process has shutdown?  Now you can!  Here's an example code snippet show how to use it:\n\n```\nimport dtale\n\ndef test_data():\n    import random\n    import pandas as pd\n    import numpy as np\n\n    df = pd.DataFrame([\n        dict(x=i, y=i % 2)\n        for i in range(30)\n    ])\n    rand_data = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(len(df), 5), columns=['z{}'.format(j) for j in range(5)])\n    return pd.concat([df, rand_data], axis=1)\n\nd = dtale.show(test_data())\nd.offline_chart(chart_type='bar', x='x', y='z3', agg='sum')\n```\n[![](http://img.youtube.com/vi/DseSmc3fZvc/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DseSmc3fZvc \"Offline Charts Tutorial\")\n\n**Pro Tip: If generating offline charts in jupyter notebooks and you run out of memory please add the following to your command-line when starting jupyter**\n\n`--NotebookApp.iopub_data_rate_limit=1.0e10`\n\n\n**Disclaimer: Long Running Chart Requests**\n\nIf you choose to build a chart that requires a lot of computational resources then it will take some time to run.  Based on the way Flask & plotly/dash interact this will block you from performing any other request until it completes.  There are two courses of action in this situation:\n\n1) Restart your jupyter notebook kernel or python console\n2) Open a new D-Tale session on a different port than the current session.  You can do that with the following command: `dtale.show(df, port=[any open port], force=True)`\n\nIf you miss the legacy (non-plotly/dash) charts, not to worry!  They are still available from the link in the upper-right corner, but on for a limited time...\nHere is the documentation for those: [Legacy Charts](https://github.com/man-group/dtale/blob/master/docs/LEGACY_CHARTS.md)\n\n**Your Feedback is Valuable**\n\nThis is a very powerful feature with many more features that could be offered (linked subplots, different statistical aggregations, etc...) so please submit issues :)\n\n#### Network Viewer\n\nThis tool gives users the ability to visualize directed graphs.  For the screenshots I'll beshowing for this functionality we'll be working off a dataframe with the following data:\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/network/data.png)\n\nStart by selecting columns containing the \"To\" and \"From\" values for the nodes in you network and then click \"Load\":\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/network/network_to_from.png)\n\nYou can also see instructions on to interact with the network by expanding the directions section by clicking on the header \"Network Viewer\" at the top.  You can also view details about the network provided by the package [networkx](https://github.com/networkx) by clicking the header \"Network Analysis\".\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/network/network_expanded.png)\n\nSelect a column containing weighting for the edges of the nodes in the \"Weight\" column and click \"Load\":\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/network/network_weight.png)\n\nSelect a column containing group information for each node in the \"From\" column by populating \"Group\" and then clicking \"Load\":\n ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/network/network_group.png)\n\n Perform shortest path analysis by doing a Shift+Click on two nodes:\n ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/network/network_shortest_path.png)\n\nView direct descendants of each node by clicking on it:\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/network/network_descendants.png)\n\nYou can zoom in on nodes by double-clicking and zoom back out by pressing \"Esc\".\n\n#### Correlations\nShows a pearson correlation matrix of all numeric columns against all other numeric columns\n  - By default, it will show a grid of pearson correlations (filtering available by using drop-down see 2nd table of screenshots)\n  - If you have a date-type column, you can click an individual cell and see a timeseries of pearson correlations for that column combination\n    - Currently if you have multiple date-type columns you will have the ability to toggle between them by way of a drop-down\n  - Furthermore, you can click on individual points in the timeseries to view the scatter plot of the points going into that correlation\n    - Within the scatter plot section you can also view the details of the PPS for those data points in the chart by hovering over the number next to \"PPS\"\n\n|Matrix|PPS|Timeseries|Scatter|\n|------|---|----------|-------|\n|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/Correlations.png)|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/Correlations_pps.png)|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/Correlations_ts.png)|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/Correlations_scatter.png)|\n\n|Col1 Filtered|Col2 Filtered|Col1 & Col2 Filtered|\n|------|----------|-------|\n|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/Correlations_col1.png)|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/Correlations_col2.png)|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/Correlations_both.png)|\n\nWhen the data being viewed in D-Tale has date or timestamp columns but for each date/timestamp vlaue there is only one row of data the behavior of the Correlations popup is a little different\n  - Instead of a timeseries correlation chart the user is given a rolling correlation chart which can have the window (default: 10) altered\n  - The scatter chart will be created when a user clicks on a point in the rollign correlation chart.  The data displayed in the scatter will be for the ranges of dates involved in the rolling correlation for that date.\n\n|Data|Correlations|\n|:------:|:------:|\n|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/rolling_corr_data.png)|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/rolling_corr.png)|\n\n#### Predictive Power Score\nPredictive Power Score (using the package [ppscore](https://github.com/8080labs/ppscore)) is an asymmetric, data-type-agnostic score that can detect linear or non-linear relationships between two columns. The score ranges from 0 (no predictive power) to 1 (perfect predictive power). It can be used as an alternative to the correlation (matrix). WARNING: This could take a while to load.\n\nThis page works similar to the [Correlations](#correlations) page but uses the PPS calcuation to populate the grid and by clicking on cells you can view the details of the PPS for those two columns in question.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/rolling_corr_data.png)|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/pps.png)\n\n#### Heat Map\nThis will hide any non-float or non-int columns (with the exception of the index on the right) and apply a color to the background of each cell.\n\n  - Each float is renormalized to be a value between 0 and 1.0\n  - You have two options for the renormalization\n    - **By Col**: each value is calculated based on the min/max of its column\n    - **Overall**: each value is caluclated by the overall min/max of all the non-hidden float/int columns in the dataset\n  - Each renormalized value is passed to a color scale of red(0) - yellow(0.5) - green(1.0)\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/Heatmap.png)\n\nTurn off Heat Map by clicking menu option you previously selected one more time\n\n#### Highlight Dtypes\nThis is a quick way to check and see if your data has been categorized correctly.  By clicking this menu option it will assign a specific background color to each column of a specific data type.\n\n|category|timedelta|float|int|date|string|bool|\n|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|\n|purple|orange|green|light blue|pink|white|yellow\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/highlight_dtypes.png)\n\n#### Highlight Missing\n\n* Any cells which contain `nan` values will be highlighted in yellow.\n* Any string column cells which are empty strings or strings consisting only of spaces will be highlighted in orange.\n*  ‚ùówill be prepended to any column header which contains missing values.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/highlight_missing.png)\n\n#### Highlight Outliers\nHighlight any cells for numeric columns which surpass the upper or lower bounds of a [custom outlier computation](#outlier-detection). \n* Lower bounds outliers will be on a red scale, where the darker reds will be near the maximum value for the column.\n* Upper bounds outliers will be on a blue scale, where the darker blues will be closer to the minimum value for the column.\n* ‚≠ê will be prepended to any column header which contains outliers.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/highlight_outliers.png)\n\n#### Highlight Range\nHighlight any range of numeric cells based on three different criteria:\n* equals\n* greater than\n* less than\n\nYou can activate as many of these criteria as you'd like nad they will be treated as an \"or\" expression.  For example, `(x == 0) or (x < -1) or (x > 1)`\n\n|Selections|Output|\n|:------:|:------:|\n|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/highlight_range_selections.png)|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/highlight_range_output.png)|\n\n#### Low Variance Flag\nShow flags on column headers where both these conditions are true:\n* Count of unique values / column size < 10%\n* Count of most common value / Count of second most common value > 20\n\nHere's an example of what this will look like when you apply it:\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/highlight_range_selections.png)|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/low_variance.png)\n\n#### Code Exports\n*Code Exports* are small snippets of code representing the current state of the grid you're viewing including things like:\n - columns built\n - filtering\n - sorting\n\nOther code exports available are:\n - Describe (Column Analysis)\n - Correlations (grid, timeseries chart & scatter chart)\n - Charts built using the Chart Builder\n\n [![](http://img.youtube.com/vi/6CkKgpv3d6I/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CkKgpv3d6I \"Code Export Tutorial\")\n\n|Type|Code Export|\n|:------:|:------:|\n|Main Grid|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/code_export/main.png)|\n|Histogram|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/code_export/histogram.png)|\n|Describe|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/code_export/describe.png)|\n|Correlation Grid|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/code_export/main.png)|\n|Correlation Timeseries|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/code_export/corr_ts.png)|\n|Correlation Scatter|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/code_export/corr_scatter.png)|\n|Charts|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/code_export/charts.png)|\n\n#### Export CSV\n\nExport your current data to either a CSV or TSV file:\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/export_csv.png)\n\n#### Load Data & Sample Datasets\n\nSo either when starting D-Tale with no pre-loaded data or after you've already loaded some data you now have the ability to load data or choose from some sample datasets directly from the GUI:\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/load_data.png)\n\nHere's the options at you disposal:\n* Load a CSV/TSV file by dragging a file to the dropzone in the top or select a file by clicking the dropzone\n* Load a CSV/TSV or JSON directly from the web by entering a URL (also throw in a proxy if you are using one)\n* Choose from one of our sample datasets:\n  * US COVID-19 data from NY Times (updated daily)\n  * Script breakdowns of popular shows Seinfeld & The Simpsons\n  * Movie dataset containing release date, director, actors, box office, reviews...\n  * Video games and their sales\n  * pandas.util.testing.makeTimeDataFrame\n\n\n**Starting with version 3.9.0 web uploads will be turned off by default.\nWeb uploads are vulnerable to blind server side request forgery, please only use in trusted environments.**\n\n**You can turn this feature on by doing one of the following:**\n - **add `enable_web_uploads=True` to your `dtale.show` call**\n - **add `enable_web_uploads = False` to the [app] section of your dtale.ini config file ([more info](https://github.com/man-group/dtale/blob/master/docs/CONFIGURATION.md))**\n - **run this code before calling dtale.show:**\n```python\nimport dtale.global_state as global_state\nglobal_state.set_app_settings(dict(enable_web_uploads=True))\n```\n\n\n#### Instances\nThis will give you information about other D-Tale instances are running under your current Python process.\n\nFor example, if you ran the following script:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport dtale\n\ndtale.show(pd.DataFrame([dict(foo=1, bar=2, biz=3, baz=4, snoopy_D_O_double_gizzle=5)]))\ndtale.show(pd.DataFrame([\n    dict(a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4),\n    dict(a=2, b=3, c=4, d=5),\n    dict(a=3, b=4, c=5, d=6),\n    dict(a=4, b=5, c=6, d=7)\n]))\ndtale.show(pd.DataFrame([range(6), range(6), range(6), range(6), range(6), range(6)]), name=\"foo\")\n```\nThis will make the **Instances** button available in all 3 of these D-Tale instances. Clicking that button while in the first instance invoked above will give you this popup:\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/Instances.png)\n\nThe grid above contains the following information:\n  - Process: timestamp when the process was started along with the name (if specified in `dtale.show()`)\n  - Rows: number of rows\n  - Columns: number of columns\n  - Column Names: comma-separated string of column names (only first 30 characters, hover for full listing)\n  - Preview: this button is available any of the non-current instances.  Clicking this will bring up left-most 5X5 grid information for that instance\n  - The row highlighted in green signifys the current D-Tale instance\n  - Any other row can be clicked to switch to that D-Tale instance\n\nHere is an example of clicking the \"Preview\" button:\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/Instances_preview.png)\n\n#### About\nThis will give you information about what version of D-Tale you're running as well as if its out of date to whats on PyPi.\n\n|Up To Date|Out Of Date|\n|--------|:------:|\n|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/About-up-to-date.png)|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/About-out-of-date.png)|\n\n#### Refresh Widths\nMostly a fail-safe in the event that your columns are no longer lining up. Click this and should fix that\n\n#### Theme\nToggle between light & dark themes for your viewing pleasure (only affects grid, not popups or charts).\n\n|Light|Dark|\n|--------|:------:|\n|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/theme/light.png)|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/theme/dark.png)|\n\n#### Reload Data\nForce a reload of the data from the server for the current rows being viewing in the grid by clicking this button. This can be helpful when viewing the grid from within another application like jupyter or nested within another website.\n\n#### Unpin/Pin Menu\nIf you would like to keep your menu pinned to the side of your grid all times rather than always having to click the triaangle in the upper left-hand corner simply click this button.  It is persisted back to the server so that it can be applied to all piece of data you've loaded into your session and beyond refreshes.\n\n#### Language\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/chinese_dtale.png)\n\nI am happy to announce that D-Tale now supports both English & Chinese (there is still more of the translation to be completed but the infrastructure is there).  And we are happy to add support for any other languages.  Please see instruction on how, [here](#adding-language-support).\n\n#### Shutdown\nPretty self-explanatory, kills your D-Tale session (there is also an auto-kill process that will kill your D-Tale after an hour of inactivity)\n\n### Column Menu Functions\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/Col_menu.png)\n\n#### Filtering\n\n[![](http://img.youtube.com/vi/8zo5ZiI1Yzo/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zo5ZiI1Yzo \"Column Filtering\")\n\nThese interactive filters come in 3 different types: String, Numeric & Date.  Note that you will still have the ability to apply custom filters from the \"Filter\" popup on the main menu, but it will get applied in addition to any column filters.\n\n|Type|Filter|Data Types|Features|\n|----|------|----------|--------|\n|String|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/filters/string.PNG)|strings & booleans|The ability to select multiple values based on what exists in the column. Notice the \"Show Missing Only\" toggle, this will only show up if your column has nan values|\n|Date|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/filters/dates.PNG)|dates|Specify a range of dates to filter on based on start & end inputs|\n|Numeric|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/filters/numeric.PNG)|ints & floats|For integers the \"=\" will be similar to strings where you can select multiple values based on what exists in the column.  You also have access to other operands: <,>,<=,>=,() - \"Range exclusve\", [] - \"Range inclusive\".|\n\n#### Moving Columns\n\n[![](http://img.youtube.com/vi/We4TH477rRs/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We4TH477rRs \"Moving Columns in D-Tale\")\n\nAll column movements are saved on the server so refreshing your browser won't lose them :ok_hand:\n\n#### Hiding Columns\n\n[![](http://img.youtube.com/vi/ryZT2Lk_YaA/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryZT2Lk_YaA \"Hide/Unhide Columns in D-Tale\")\n\nAll column movements are saved on the server so refreshing your browser won't lose them :ok_hand:\n\n#### Delete\n\nAs simple as it sounds, click this button to delete this column from your dataframe.\n\n#### Rename\n\nUpdate the name of any column in your dataframe to a name that is not currently in use by your dataframe.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/rename.png)\n\n#### Replacements\n\nThis feature allows users to replace content on their column directly or for safer purposes in a brand new column.  Here are the options you have:\n\n|Type        |Data Types   |Description|Menu    |\n|------------|-------------|-----------|--------|\n|Value(s)    |all          |Replace specific values in a column with raw values, output from another column or an aggregation on your column|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/replacements_value.png)|\n|Spaces Only |strings      |Replace string values consisting only of spaces with raw values|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/replacements_spaces.png)|\n|Contains Char/Substring|strings      |Replace string values containing a specific character or substring|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/replacements_strings.png)|\n|Scikit-Learn Imputer|numeric      |Replace missing values with the output of using different Scikit-Learn imputers like iterative, knn & simple|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/replacements_sklearn.png)|\n\nHere's a quick demo: [![](http://img.youtube.com/vi/GiNFRtcpIt8/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiNFRtcpIt8 \"Column Replacements\")\n\n#### Lock\nAdds your column to \"locked\" columns\n  - \"locked\" means that if you scroll horizontally these columns will stay pinned to the right-hand side\n  - this is handy when you want to keep track of which date or security_id you're looking at\n  - by default, any index columns on the data passed to D-Tale will be locked\n\n#### Unlock\nRemoved column from \"locked\" columns\n\n#### Sorting\nApplies/removes sorting (Ascending/Descending/Clear) to the column selected\n  \n*Important*: as you add sorts they sort added will be added to the end of the multi-sort.  For example:\n\n| Action        | Sort           |\n| ------------- |:--------------:|\n| click \"a\"     |                |\n| sort asc      | a (asc)        |\n| click \"b\"     | a (asc)        |\n| sort desc     | a (asc), b(desc)|\n| click \"a\"     | a (asc), b(desc)|\n| sort None     | b(desc)|\n| sort desc     | b(desc), a(desc)|\n| click \"X\" on sort display | |\n\n#### Formats\nApply simple formats to numeric values in your grid\n\n|Type|Editing|Result|\n|--------|:------:|:------:|\n|Numeric|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/Formatting_apply.png)|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/Post_formatting.png)|\n|Date|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/Formatting_date_apply.png)|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/Post_date_formatting.png)|\n|String|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/Formatting_string_apply.png)|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/Post_string_formatting.png)|\n\nFor all data types you have the ability to change what string is ued for display.\n\n\nFor numbers here's a grid of all the formats available with -123456.789 as input:\n  \n| Format        | Output         |\n| ------------- |:--------------:|\n| Precision (6) | -123456.789000 |\n| Thousands Sep | -123,456.789   |\n| Abbreviate    | -123k          |\n| Exponent      | -1e+5          |\n| BPS           | -1234567890BPS |\n| Red Negatives | <span style=\"color: red;\">-123457</span>|\n\nFor strings you can apply the follwoing formats:\n* **Truncation:** truncate long strings to a certain number of characters and replace with an allipses \"...\" and see the whole value on hover.\n* **Hyperlinks:** If your column is comprised of URL strings you can make them hyperlinks which will open a new tab\n\n#### Describe (Column Analysis)\nBased on the data type of a column different charts will be shown.  This side panel can be closed using the 'X' button in the upper right or by pressing the ESC key.\n\n| Chart         | Data Types     | Sample |\n|---------------|----------------|--------|\n| Box Plot      | Float, Int, Date | ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/analysis/boxplot.png)|\n| Histogram     | Float, Int |![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/analysis/histogram.PNG)|\n| Value Counts  | Int, String, Bool, Date, Category|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/analysis/value_counts.PNG)|\n| Word Value Counts | String | ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/analysis/word_value_counts.png)|\n| Category      | Float   |![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/analysis/category.PNG)|\n| Geolocation*  | Int, Float     |![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/analysis/geolocation.PNG)|\n| Q-Q Plot      | Int, Float, Date |![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/analysis/qq.png)|\n\n\n**Histogram** can be displayed in any number of bins (default: 20), simply type a new integer value in the bins input\n\n**Value Count** by default, show the top 100 values ranked by frequency.  If you would like to show the least frequent values simply make your number negative (-10 => 10 least frequent value)\n\n**Value Count w/ Ordinal** you can also apply an ordinal to your **Value Count** chart by selecting a column (of type int or float) and applying an aggregation (default: sum) to it (sum, mean, etc...) this column will be grouped by the column you're analyzing and the value produced by the aggregation will be used to sort your bars and also displayed in a line.  Here's an example:\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aschonfeld/dtale-media/master/images/analysis/value_counts_ordinal.PNG\n)\n\n**Word Value Count** you can analyze string data by splitting each record by spaces to see the counts of each word.  This chart has all the same functions available as \"Value Counts\".  In addition, you can select multiple \"Cleaner\" functions to be applied to your column before building word values. These functions will perform operations like removing punctuation, removing numeric character & normalizing accent characters.\n\n**Category (Category Breakdown)** when viewing float columns you can also see them broken down by a categorical column (string, date, int, etc...).  This means that when you select a category column this will then display the frequency of each category in a line as well as bars based on the float column you're analyzing grouped by that category and computed by your aggregation (default: mean).\n\n**Geolocation** when your data contains latitude & longitude then you can view the coverage in a plotly scattergeo map.  In order to have access this chart your dataframe must have at least one of each of these types of columns:\n* \"lat\" must be contained within the lower-cased version of the column name and values be between -90 & 90\n* \"lon\" must be contained within the lower-cased version of the column name and values be between -180 & 180\n\n### Hotkeys\n\nThese are key combinations you can use in place of clicking actual buttons to save a little time:\n\n| Keymap      | Action         |\n|-------------|----------------|\n|`shift+m`    | Opens main menu*|\n|`shift+d`    | Opens \"Describe\" page*|\n|`shift+f`    | Opens \"Custom Filter\"*|\n|`shift+b`    | Opens \"Build Column\"*|\n|`shift+c`    | Opens \"Charts\" page*|\n|`shift+x`    | Opens \"Code Export\"*|\n|`esc`        | Closes any open modal window or side panel & exits cell editing|\n\n`*` Does not fire if user is actively editing a cell.\n\n### Menu Functions Depending on Browser Dimensions\nDepending on the dimensions of your browser window the following buttons will not open modals, but rather separate browser windows:  Correlations, Describe & Instances (see images from [Jupyter Notebook](#jupyter-notebook), also Charts will always open in a separate browser window)\n\n## For Developers\n\n### Cloning\n\nClone the code (git clone ssh://git@github.com:manahl/dtale.git), then start the backend server:\n\n```bash\n$ git clone ssh://git@github.com:manahl/dtale.git\n# install the dependencies\n$ python setup.py develop\n# start the server\n$ dtale --csv-path /home/jdoe/my_csv.csv --csv-parse_dates date\n```\n\nYou can also run dtale from PyDev directly.\n\nYou will also want to import javascript dependencies and build the source (all javascript code resides in the `frontend` folder):\n\n``` bash\n$ cd frontend\n$ npm install\n# 1) a persistent server that serves the latest JS:\n$ npm run watch\n# 2) or one-off build:\n$ npm run build\n```\n\n### Running tests\n\nThe usual npm test command works:\n\n```\n$ npm test\n```\n\nYou can run individual test files:\n\n```\n$ npm run test -- static/__tests__/dtale/DataViewer-base-test.jsx\n```\n\n### Linting\n\nYou can lint all the JS and CSS to confirm there's nothing obviously wrong with\nit:\n\n``` bash\n$ npm run lint\n```\n\nYou can also lint individual JS files:\n\n``` bash\n$ npm run lint-js-file -s -- static/dtale/DataViewer.jsx\n```\n\n### Formatting JS\n\nYou can auto-format code as follows:\n\n``` bash\n$ npm run format\n```\n\n### Docker Development\n\nYou can build python 27-3 & run D-Tale as follows:\n```bash\n$ yarn run build\n$ docker-compose build dtale_2_7\n$ docker run -it --network host dtale_2_7:latest\n$ python\n>>> import pandas as pd\n>>> df = pd.DataFrame([dict(a=1,b=2,c=3)])\n>>> import dtale\n>>> dtale.show(df)\n```\nThen view your D-Tale instance in your browser using the link that gets printed\n\nYou can build python 36-1 & run D-Tale as follows:\n```bash\n$ yarn run build\n$ docker-compose build dtale_3_6\n$ docker run -it --network host dtale_3_6:latest\n$ python\n>>> import pandas as pd\n>>> df = pd.DataFrame([dict(a=1,b=2,c=3)])\n>>> import dtale\n>>> dtale.show(df)\n```\nThen view your D-Tale instance in your browser using the link that gets printed\n\n\n### Adding Language Support\n\nCurrently D-Tale support both english & chinese but other languages will gladly be supported.  To add another language simply open a pull request with the following:\n- cake a copy & translate the values in the following JSON english JSON files and save them to the same locations as each file\n - [Back-End](https://github.com/man-group/dtale/blob/master/dtale/translations/en.json)\n - [Front-End](https://github.com/man-group/dtale/blob/master/static/translations/en.json)\n- please make the name of these files the name of the language you are adding (currently english -> en, chinese -> cn) \n- be sure to keep the keys in english, that is important\n\nLooking forward to what languages come next! :smile:\n\n\n## Global State/Data Storage\n\nIf D-Tale is running in an environment with multiple python processes (ex: on a web server running [gunicorn](https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn)) it will most likely encounter issues with inconsistent state.  Developers can fix this by configuring the system D-Tale uses for storing data.  Detailed documentation is available here: [Data Storage and managing Global State](https://github.com/man-group/dtale/blob/master/docs/GLOBAL_STATE.md)\n\n\n## Startup Behavior\n\nHere's a little background on how the `dtale.show()` function works:\n - by default it will look for ports between 40000 & 49000, but you can change that range by specifying the environment variables DTALE_MIN_PORT & DTALE_MAX_PORT\n - think of sessions as python consoles or jupyter notebooks\n\n1) Session 1 executes `dtale.show(df)` our state is:\n\n|Session|Port|Active Data IDs|URL(s)|\n|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|\n|1|40000|1|http://localhost:40000/dtale/main/1|\n\n2) Session 1 executes `dtale.show(df)` our state is:\n\n|Session|Port|Active Data IDs|URL(s)|\n|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|\n|1|40000|1,2|http://localhost:40000/dtale/main/[1,2]|\n\n2) Session 2 executes `dtale.show(df)` our state is:\n\n|Session|Port|Active Data IDs|URL(s)|\n|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|\n|1|40000|1,2|http://localhost:40000/dtale/main/[1,2]|\n|2|40001|1|http://localhost:40001/dtale/main/1|\n\n3) Session 1 executes `dtale.show(df, port=40001, force=True)` our state is:\n\n|Session|Port|Active Data IDs|URL(s)|\n|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|\n|1|40001|1,2,3|http://localhost:40001/dtale/main/[1,2,3]|\n\n4) Session 3 executes `dtale.show(df)` our state is:\n\n|Session|Port|Active Data IDs|URL(s)|\n|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|\n|1|40001|1,2,3|http://localhost:40001/dtale/main/[1,2,3]|\n|3|40000|1|http://localhost:40000/dtale/main/1|\n\n5) Session 2 executes `dtale.show(df)` our state is:\n\n|Session|Port|Active Data IDs|URL(s)|\n|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|\n|1|40001|1,2,3|http://localhost:40001/dtale/main/[1,2,3]|\n|3|40000|1|http://localhost:40000/dtale/main/1|\n|2|40002|1|http://localhost:40002/dtale/main/1|\n\n6) Session 4 executes `dtale.show(df, port=8080)` our state is:\n\n|Session|Port|Active Data IDs|URL(s)|\n|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|\n|1|40001|1,2,3|http://localhost:40001/dtale/main/[1,2,3]|\n|3|40000|1|http://localhost:40000/dtale/main/1|\n|2|40002|1|http://localhost:40002/dtale/main/1|\n|4|8080|1|http://localhost:8080/dtale/main/1|\n\n7) Session 1 executes `dtale.get_instance(1).kill()` our state is:\n\n|Session|Port|Active Data IDs|URL(s)|\n|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|\n|1|40001|2,3|http://localhost:40001/dtale/main/[2,3]|\n|3|40000|1|http://localhost:40000/dtale/main/1|\n|2|40002|1|http://localhost:40002/dtale/main/1|\n|4|8080|1|http://localhost:8080/dtale/main/1|\n\n7) Session 5 sets DTALE_MIN_RANGE to 30000 and DTALE_MAX_RANGE 39000 and executes `dtale.show(df)` our state is:\n\n|Session|Port|Active Data ID(s)|URL(s)|\n|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|\n|1|40001|2,3|http://localhost:40001/dtale/main/[2,3]|\n|3|40000|1|http://localhost:40000/dtale/main/1|\n|2|40002|1|http://localhost:40002/dtale/main/1|\n|4|8080|1|http://localhost:8080/dtale/main/1|\n|5|30000|1|http://localhost:30000/dtale/main/1|\n\n## Documentation\n\nHave a look at the [detailed documentation](https://dtale.readthedocs.io).\n\n## Dependencies\n\n* Back-end\n  * dash\n  * dash_daq\n  * Flask\n  * Flask-Compress\n  * Pandas\n  * plotly\n  * scikit-learn\n  * scipy\n  * xarray\n  * arctic [extra]\n  * dash-bio [extra]\n  * flask-ngrok [extra]\n  * redis [extra]\n  * rpy2 [extra]\n  * streamlit [extra]\n  * swifter [extra]\n* Front-end\n  * react-virtualized\n  * chart.js\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nD-Tale has been under active development at [Man Numeric](http://www.numeric.com/) since 2019.\n\nOriginal concept and implementation: [Andrew Schonfeld](https://github.com/aschonfeld)\n\nContributors:\n\n * [Phillip Dupuis](https://github.com/phillipdupuis)\n * [Fernando Saravia Rajal](https://github.com/fersarr)\n * [Dominik Christ](https://github.com/DominikMChrist)\n * [Reza Moshksar](https://github.com/reza1615)\n * [Bertrand Nouvel](https://github.com/bnouvelbmll)\n * [Chris Boddy](https://github.com/cboddy)\n * [Jason Holden](https://github.com/jasonkholden)\n * [Tom Taylor](https://github.com/TomTaylorLondon)\n * [Wilfred Hughes](https://github.com/Wilfred)\n * Mike Kelly\n * [Vincent Riemer](https://github.com/vincentriemer)\n * [Youssef Habchi](http://youssef-habchi.com/) - title font\n * [Yadhu Krishna](https://github.com/yadhukrishnam)\n * ... and many others ...\n\nContributions welcome!\n\n## License\n\nD-Tale is licensed under the GNU LGPL v2.1.

See\nhttps://palletsprojects.com/security, the canonical location for the policy,\nwhich this is copied from.\n\n## Before Reporting\n\nThere are some things we generally do not consider security issues, which can be\nfound at the canonical policy page: https://palletsprojects.com/security. Please\nreview the list before reporting an issue. You may still err on the side of\ncaution and make a private report first, but we may close it or ask you to\nreport a regular issue instead.\n\n## Reporting a Security Issue\n\nIf you believe you have identified a security issue with a Pallets or\nPallets-Eco project, **do not open a public issue**. To responsibly report a\nsecurity issue, use GitHub's [security advisory system][gh-docs]. From the\nproject's repository, click \"Security\" at the top, then click \"Advisories\" at\nthe left, then click the green \"New draft security advisory\" button.\nAlternatively, you may email [security@palletsprojects.com](mailto:security@palletsprojects.com),\nand we will convert that to a GitHub security advisory.\n\nBe sure to include as much detail as necessary in your report. As with reporting\nnormal issues, a minimal reproducible example will help the maintainers address\nthe issue faster. Information about why the issue is a security issue is also\nhelpful. If you are able, you may also provide a fix for the issue.\n\nA maintainer will reply acknowledging the report and how to continue. We will\nobtain a CVE id as well, please do not do this on your own. We will work with\nyou to attempt to understand the issue and decide on its validity. Maintainers\nare volunteers working in their free time, and therefore cannot guarantee any\nspecific timeline. Please be patient during this process.\n\nThe current feature release will receive security fixes. A backport to the\nprevious feature branch may be considered upon request based on usage information\nand severity, but is not guaranteed.\n\n[gh-docs]: https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/creating-a-repository-security-advisory\n",

Then the template is passed data to render the final document.\n\nIt includes:\n\n-   Template inheritance and inclusion.\n-   Define and import macros within templates.\n-   HTML templates can use autoescaping to prevent XSS from untrusted\n    user input.\n-   A sandboxed environment can safely render untrusted templates.\n-   AsyncIO support for generating templates and calling async\n    functions.\n-   I18N support with Babel.\n-   Templates are compiled to optimized Python code just-in-time and\n    cached, or can be compiled ahead-of-time.\n-   Exceptions point to the correct line in templates to make debugging\n    easier.\n-   Extensible filters, tests, functions, and even syntax.\n\nJinja's philosophy is that while application logic belongs in Python if\npossible, it shouldn't make the template designer's job difficult by\nrestricting functionality too much.\n\n\n## In A Nutshell\n\n```jinja\n{% extends \"base.html\" %}\n{% block title %}Members{% endblock %}\n{% block content %}\n  <ul>\n  {% for user in users %}\n    <li><a href=\"{{ user.url }}\">{{ user.username }}</a></li>\n  {% endfor %}\n  </ul>\n{% endblock %}\n```\n\n## Donate\n\nThe Pallets organization develops and supports Jinja and other popular\npackages.

is a content management platform with its backend written in Python.\nPlone has a choice of frontend, either Classic UI using server-side templates or Volto written in modern React-based JavaScript.\nIt builds upon Zope, an open source web application server and development system, and thus on the pluggable Zope Component Architecture (ZCA).\n\nPython is the easy to learn, widely used, and supported open source programming language.\nPython can be used to add new features to Plone and used to understand or make changes to the way that Plone works.\n\nPlone stores its contents in Zope's built-in transactional hierarchical object database, the ZODB.\nThe ZODB can be connected to simple file-storages, scalable ZEO-Servers or Postgres, MySQL, and Oracle.\nThere are add-ons and techniques, however, to share information with other sources, such as relational databases, LDAP, filesystem\nfiles, and so on.\n\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">\nOfficial Resources\n</h2>\n\n*

We appreciate efforts to improve the security of MLflow\nand follow the [GitHub coordinated disclosure of security vulnerabilities](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/about-coordinated-disclosure-of-security-vulnerabilities#about-reporting-and-disclosing-vulnerabilities-in-projects-on-github)\nfor responsible disclosure and prompt mitigation. We are committed to working with security researchers to\nresolve the vulnerabilities they discover.\n\n## Supported Versions\n\nThe latest version of MLflow has continued support. If a critical vulnerability is found in the current version\nof MLflow, we may opt to backport patches to previous versions.\n\n## Reporting a Vulnerability\n\nWhen finding a security vulnerability in MLflow, please perform the following actions:\n\n- [Open an issue](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report_template.md&title=%5BBUG%5D%20Security%20Vulnerability) on the MLflow repository. Ensure that you use `[BUG] Security Vulnerability` as the title and _do not_ mention any vulnerability details in the issue post.\n- Send a notification [email](mailto:mlflow-oss-maintainers@googlegroups.com) to `mlflow-oss-maintainers@googlegroups.com` that contains, at a minimum:\n  - The link to the filed issue stub.\n  - Your GitHub handle.\n  - Detailed information about the security vulnerability, evidence that supports the relevance of the finding and any reproducibility instructions for independent confirmation.\n\nThis first stage of reporting is to ensure that a rapid validation can occur without wasting the time and effort of a reporter. Future communication and vulnerability resolution will be conducted after validating\nthe veracity of the reported issue.\n\nAn MLflow maintainer will, after validating the report:\n\n- Acknowledge the [bug](ISSUE_POLICY.md#bug-reports) during [triage](ISSUE_TRIAGE.rst)\n- Mark the issue as `priority/critical-urgent`\n- Open a draft [GitHub Security Advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/creating-a-security-advisory)\n  to discuss the vulnerability details in private.\n\nThe private Security Advisory will be used to confirm the issue, prepare a fix, and publicly disclose it after the fix has been released.\n",

MLflow offers a set of lightweight APIs that can be\nused with any existing machine learning application or library (TensorFlow, PyTorch, XGBoost, etc), wherever you\ncurrently run ML code (e.g. in notebooks, standalone applications or the cloud). MLflow's current components are:\n\n* `MLflow Tracking <https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html>`_: An API to log parameters, code, and\n  results in machine learning experiments and compare them using an interactive UI.\n* `MLflow Projects <https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/projects.html>`_: A code packaging format for reproducible\n  runs using Conda and Docker, so you can share your ML code with others.\n* `MLflow Models <https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html>`_: A model packaging format and tools that let\n  you easily deploy the same model (from any ML library) to batch and real-time scoring on platforms such as\n  Docker, Apache Spark, Azure ML and AWS SageMaker.\n* `MLflow Model Registry <https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/model-registry.html>`_: A centralized model store, set of APIs, and UI, to collaboratively manage the full lifecycle of MLflow Models.\n\n|docs| |license| |downloads| |slack| |twitter|\n\n.. |docs| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-latest-success.svg?style=for-the-badge\n    :target: https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html\n    :alt: Latest Docs\n.. |license| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%202-brightgreen.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=apache\n    :target: https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/LICENSE.txt\n    :alt: Apache 2 License\n.. |downloads| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/dw/mlflow?style=for-the-badge&logo=pypi&logoColor=white\n    :target: https://pepy.tech/project/mlflow\n    :alt: Total Downloads\n.. |slack| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/slack-@mlflow--users-CF0E5B.svg?logo=slack&logoColor=white&labelColor=3F0E40&style=for-the-badge\n    :target: `Slack`_\n    :alt: Slack\n.. |twitter| image:: https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/MLflow?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=00ACEE&logo=twitter&logoColor=white\n    :target: https://twitter.com/MLflow\n    :alt: Account Twitter\n\nPackages\n\n+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+\n| PyPI          | |pypi-mlflow| |pypi-skinny|                                 |\n+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+\n| conda-forge   | |conda-mlflow| |conda-skinny|                               |\n+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+\n| CRAN          | |cran-mlflow|                                               |\n+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Maven Central | |maven-client| |maven-parent| |maven-scoring| |maven-spark| |\n+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n.. |pypi-mlflow| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/mlflow.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=pypi&logoColor=white&label=mlflow\n    :target: https://pypi.org/project/mlflow/\n    :alt: PyPI -

We are\nseeking contributions to all of our roadmap items with the ``help wanted`` label. Please see the\n`Contributing`_ section for more information.\n\nCommunity\n---------\nFor help or questions about MLflow usage (e.g. \"how do I do X?\") see the `docs <https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html>`_\nor `Stack Overflow <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow>`_.\n\nTo report a bug, file a documentation issue, or submit a feature request, please open a GitHub issue.\n\nFor release announcements and other discussions, please subscribe to our mailing list (mlflow-users@googlegroups.com)\nor join us on `Slack`_.\n\nRunning a Sample App With the Tracking API\n------------------------------------------\nThe programs in ``examples`` use the MLflow Tracking API. For instance, run::\n\n    python examples/quickstart/mlflow_tracking.py\n\nThis program will use `MLflow Tracking API <https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html>`_,\nwhich logs tracking data in ``./mlruns``. This can then be viewed with the Tracking UI.\n\n\nLaunching the Tracking UI\n-------------------------\nThe MLflow Tracking UI will show runs logged in ``./mlruns`` at `<http://localhost:5000>`_.\nStart it with::\n\n    mlflow ui\n\n**Note:** Running ``mlflow ui`` from within a clone of MLflow is not recommended - doing so will\nrun the dev UI from source. We recommend running the UI from a different working directory,\nspecifying a backend store via the ``--backend-store-uri`` option. Alternatively, see\ninstructions for running the dev UI in the `contributor guide <CONTRIBUTING.md>`_.\n\n\nRunning a Project from a URI\n----------------------------\nThe ``mlflow run`` command lets you run a project packaged with a MLproject file from a local path\nor a Git URI::\n\n    mlflow run examples/sklearn_elasticnet_wine -P alpha=0.4\n\n    mlflow run https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow-example.git -P alpha=0.4\n\nSee ``examples/sklearn_elasticnet_wine`` for a sample project with an MLproject file.\n\n\nSaving and Serving Models\n-------------------------\nTo illustrate managing models, the ``mlflow.sklearn`` package can log scikit-learn models as\nMLflow artifacts and then load them again for serving. There is an example training application in\n``examples/sklearn_logistic_regression/train.py`` that you can run as follows::\n\n    $ python examples/sklearn_logistic_regression/train.py\n    Score: 0.666\n    Model saved in run <run-id>\n\n    $ mlflow models serve --model-uri runs:/<run-id>/model\n\n    $ curl -d '{\"dataframe_split\": {\"columns\":[0],\"index\":[0,1],\"data\":[[1],[-1]]}}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  localhost:5000/invocations\n\n**Note:** If using MLflow skinny (``pip install mlflow-skinny``) for model serving, additional\nrequired dependencies (namely, ``flask``) will need to be installed for the MLflow server to function.\n\nOfficial MLflow Docker Image\n----------------------------\n\nThe official MLflow Docker image is available on GitHub Container Registry at https://ghcr.io/mlflow/mlflow.\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    export CR_PAT=YOUR_TOKEN\n    echo $CR_PAT | docker login ghcr.io -u USERNAME --password-stdin\n    # Pull the latest version\n    docker pull ghcr.io/mlflow/mlflow\n    # Pull 2.2.1\n    docker pull ghcr.io/mlflow/mlflow:v2.2.1\n\nContributing\n------------\nWe happily welcome contributions to MLflow. We are also seeking contributions to items on the\n`MLflow Roadmap <https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/milestone/3>`_. Please see our\n`contribution guide <CONTRIBUTING.md>`_ to learn more about contributing to MLflow.\n\nCore Members\n------------\n\nMLflow is currently maintained by the following core members with significant contributions from hundreds of exceptionally talented community members.\n\n- `Ben Wilson <https://github.com/BenWilson2>`_\n- `Corey Zumar <https://github.com/dbczumar>`_\n- `Daniel Lok <https://github.com/daniellok-db>`_\n- `Gabriel Fu <https://github.com/gabrielfu>`_\n- `Harutaka Kawamura <https://github.com/harupy>`_\n- `Serena Ruan <https://github.com/serena-ruan>`_\n- `Weichen Xu <https://github.com/WeichenXu123>`_\n- `Yuki Watanabe <https://github.com/B-Step62>`_\n",

Please update\nyour references to `https://github.com/pallets-eco/flask-admin.git`.\n\n[![image](https://d322cqt584bo4o.cloudfront.net/flask-admin/localized.svg)](https://crowdin.com/project/flask-admin) [![image](https://github.com/pallets-eco/flask-admin/actions/workflows/tests.yaml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/pallets-eco/flask-admin/actions/workflows/test.yaml)\n\n## Pallets Community Ecosystem\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\\\n> This project is part of the Pallets Community Ecosystem. Pallets is the open\n> source organization that maintains Flask; Pallets-Eco enables community\n> maintenance of related projects. If you are interested in helping maintain\n> this project, please reach out on [the Pallets Discord server][discord].\n\n[discord]: https://discord.gg/pallets\n\n## Introduction\n\nFlask-Admin is a batteries-included, simple-to-use\n[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) extension that lets you add admin\ninterfaces to Flask applications. It is inspired by the *django-admin*\npackage, but implemented in such a way that the developer has total\ncontrol over the look, feel, functionality and user experience of the resulting\napplication.\n\nOut-of-the-box, Flask-Admin plays nicely with various ORM\\'s, including\n\n-   [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)\n-   [pymongo](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/)\n-   and [Peewee](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee).\n\nIt also boasts a simple file management interface and a [Redis\nclient](https://redis.io/) console.\n\nThe biggest feature of Flask-Admin is its flexibility. It aims to provide a\nset of simple tools that can be used to build admin interfaces of\nany complexity. To start off, you can create a very simple\napplication in no time, with auto-generated CRUD-views for each of your\nmodels. Then you can further customize those views and forms as\nthe need arises.\n\nFlask-Admin is an active project, well-tested and production-ready.\n\n## Examples\n\nSeveral usage examples are included in the */examples* folder. Please\nadd your own, or improve on the existing examples, and submit a\n*pull-request*.\n\nTo run the examples in your local environment:\n1. Clone the repository:\n\n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/pallets-eco/flask-admin.git\n    cd flask-admin\n    ```\n2. Create and activate a virtual environment:\n\n    ```bash\n    # Windows:\n    python -m venv .venv\n    .venv\\Scripts\\activate\n\n    # Linux:\n    python3 -m venv .venv\n    source .venv/bin/activate\n    ```\n3. Install requirements:\n\n    ```bash\n    pip install -r examples/sqla/requirements.txt\n    ```\n4. Run the application:\n\n    ```bash\n    python examples/sqla/run_server.py\n    ```\n5. Check the Flask app running on <http://localhost:5000>.\n\n## Documentation\n\nFlask-Admin is extensively documented, you can find all of the\ndocumentation at <https://flask-admin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>.\n\nThe docs are auto-generated from the *.rst* files in the */doc* folder.\nIf you come across any errors or if you think of anything else that\nshould be included, feel free to make the changes and submit a *pull-request*.\n\nTo build the docs in your local environment, from the project directory:\n\n    tox -e docs-html\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install Flask-Admin, simply:\n\n    pip install flask-admin\n\nOr alternatively, you can download the repository and install manually\nby doing:\n\n    git clone https://github.com/pallets-eco/flask-admin.git\n    cd flask-admin\n    pip install .\n\n## Tests\n\nTests are run with *pytest*. If you are not familiar with this package, you can find out more on [their website](https://pytest.org/).\n\nTo run the tests, from the project directory, simply run:\n\n    pip install --use-pep517 -r requirements/dev.txt\n    pytest\n\nYou should see output similar to:\n\n    .............................................\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Ran 102 tests in 13.132s\n\n    OK\n\n**NOTE!** For all the tests to pass successfully, you\\'ll need Postgres (with\nthe postgis and hstore extension) & MongoDB to be running locally. You'll\nalso need *libgeos* available.\n\nFor Postgres:\n```bash\npsql postgres\n> CREATE DATABASE flask_admin_test;\n> # Connect to database \"flask_admin_test\":\n> \\c flask_admin_test;\n> CREATE EXTENSION postgis;\n> CREATE EXTENSION hstore;\n```\nIf you\\'re using Homebrew on MacOS, you might need this:\n\n```bash\n# Install postgis and geos\nbrew install postgis\nbrew install geos\n\n# Set up a PostgreSQL user\ncreateuser -s postgresql\nbrew services restart postgresql\n```\n\nYou can also run the tests on multiple environments using *tox*.\n\n## 3rd Party Stuff\n\nFlask-Admin is built with the help of\n[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/),\n[Select2](https://github.com/ivaynberg/select2) and\n[Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/).\n\nIf you want to localize your application, install the\n[Flask-Babel](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Flask-Babel) package.\n\nYou can help improve Flask-Admin\\'s translations through Crowdin:\n<https://crowdin.com/project/flask-admin>\n",

After installing `doxygen`, you only need to run `doxygen` to generate the API documents whose main page is under the `doxygen/html/index.html` path.\n\n## Build with vcpkg\n\nSince it's integrated with vcpkg, see [vcpkg#README](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg#readme) for the requirements. See [LEGACY_BUILD](./LEGACY_BUILD.md) if you want to manage dependencies by yourself or you cannot install vcpkg in your own environment.\n\n### How to build from source\n\nThe simplest way is to clone this project with the vcpkg submodule.\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/apache/pulsar-client-cpp.git\ncd pulsar-client-cpp\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\ncmake -B build -DINTEGRATE_VCPKG=ON\ncmake --build build -j8\n```\n\nThe 1st step will download vcpkg and then install all dependencies according to the version description in [vcpkg.json](./vcpkg.json). The 2nd step will build the Pulsar C++ libraries under `./build/lib/`, where `./build` is the CMake build directory.\n\n> You can also add the CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE option if your system already have vcpkg installed.\n>\n> ```bash\n> git clone https://github.com/apache/pulsar-client-cpp.git\n> cd pulsar-client-cpp\n> # For example, you can install vcpkg in /tmp/vcpkg\n> cd /tmp && git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git && cd -\n> cmake -B build -DINTEGRATE_VCPKG=ON -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=\"/tmp/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake\"\n> cmake --build build -j8\n> ```\n\nAfter the build, the hierarchy of the `build` directory will be:\n\n```\nbuild/\n  include/   -- extra C++ headers\n  lib/       -- libraries\n  tests/     -- test executables\n  examples/  -- example executables\n  generated/\n    lib/     -- protobuf source files for PulsarApi.proto\n    tests/   -- protobuf source files for *.proto used in tests\n```\n\n### How to install\n\nTo install the C++ headers and libraries into a specific path, e.g. `/tmp/pulsar`, run the following commands:\n\n```bash\ncmake -B build -DINTEGRATE_VCPKG=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/tmp/pulsar\ncmake --build build -j8 --target install\n```\n\nFor example, on macOS you will see:\n\n```\n/tmp/pulsar/\n  include/pulsar     -- C/C++ headers\n  lib/\n    libpulsar.a      -- Static library\n    libpulsar.dylib  -- Dynamic library\n```\n\n### Tests\n\nTests are built by default. You should execute [run-unit-tests.sh](./run-unit-tests.sh) to run tests locally.\n\nIf you don't want to build the tests, disable the `BUILD_TESTS` option:\n\n```bash\ncmake -B build -DINTEGRATE_VCPKG=ON -DBUILD_TESTS=OFF\ncmake --build build -j8\n```\n\n### Build perf tools\n\nIf you want to build the perf tools, enable the `BUILD_PERF_TOOLS` option:\n\n```bash\ncmake -B build -DINTEGRATE_VCPKG=ON -DBUILD_PERF_TOOLS=ON\ncmake --build build -j8\n```\n\nThen the perf tools will be built under `./build/perf/`.\n\n## Platforms\n\nPulsar C++ Client Library has been tested on:\n\n- Linux\n- Mac OS X\n- Windows x64\n\n## Wireshark Dissector\n\nSee the [wireshark](wireshark/) directory for details.\n\n## Requirements for Contributors\n\nIt's required to install [LLVM](https://llvm.org/builds/) for `clang-tidy` and `clang-format`. Pulsar C++ client use `clang-format` **11** to format files. `make format` automatically formats the files.\n\nFor Ubuntu users, you can install `clang-format-11` via `apt install clang-format-11`. For other users, run `./build-support/docker-format.sh` if you have Docker installed.\n\nWe welcome contributions from the open source community, kindly make sure your changes are backward compatible with GCC 4.8 and Boost 1.53.\n\nIf your contribution adds Pulsar features for C++ clients, you need to update both the [Pulsar docs](https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/client-libraries/) and the [Client Feature Matrix](https://pulsar.apache.org/client-feature-matrix/). See [Contribution Guide](https://pulsar.apache.org/contribute/site-intro/#pages) for more details.\n",

In this example, we present an example of a Voil√† application powered by the C++ Jupyter kernel [xeus-cling](https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/xeus-cling), and the [xleaflet](https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/xleaflet) project.\n\n![Voil√† cling](voila-cling.gif)\n\n## The Voil√† Gallery\n\nThe [Voil√† Gallery](https://voila-gallery.org) is a collection of live dashboards and applications built with Voil√† and Jupyter widgets.\n\nMost of the examples rely on widget libraries such as ipywidgets, ipyleaflet, ipyvolume, bqplot and ipympl, and showcase how to build complex web applications entirely based on notebooks.\n\nNew examples can be added to the gallery by following the steps listed in the [voila-gallery/gallery](https://github.com/voila-gallery/gallery) repository.\n\n## Development\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to know how to contribute and set up a development environment.\n\n## Related projects\n\nVoil√† depends on [nbconvert](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert) and\n[jupyter_server](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/).\n\n## License\n\nWe use a shared copyright model that enables all contributors to maintain the\ncopyright on their contributions.\n\nThis software is licensed under the BSD-3-Clause license.

We will do our best to respond to your report within \n7 days and also to keep you informed of the progress of our efforts to resolve the issue, \nbut understand that ESPHome, like many open source projects, is relying heavily on \nvolunteers that aren‚Äôt full-time resources. We may not be able to respond as quickly as you \nwould like due to other responsibilities.\n\n## SUPPORTED VERSIONS\n\nWe only accept reports against the latest stable & official versions of ESPHome or any versions \nbeyond that are currently in development or beta test. \nThe latest version can be found on our [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/releases).\n\nWe do not accept reports against forks of ESPHome.\n\n## PUBLIC DISCLOSURE & CVE ASSIGNMENT\n\nWe will publish GitHub Security Advisories and through those, will also request CVEs, \nfor valid vulnerabilities that meet the following criteria:\n\n- The vulnerability is in ESPHome itself, not any third-party library or external component.\n- The vulnerability is not already known to us.\n- The vulnerability is not already known to the public.\n- CVEs will only be requested for vulnerabilities with a severity of medium or higher.\n\n## BOUNTIES\nAs an open source project, ESPHome cannot offer bounties for security vulnerabilities. \nHowever, if so desired, we of course will credit the discoverer of a vulnerability.\n",

Couldn't this be used to also downgrade to WEP, and then break that? I will have to look at how WEP attacks work (if it's during handshake phase or later)\r\n - [ ] Test the mitigation actually works (not sure if I'll be able to do that, I don't have the hardware around to create wifi packets in promiscuous mode)\r\n\r\n**Related issue (if applicable):** fixes <link to issue>\r\n\r\n**Pull request in [esphome-docs](https://github.com/esphome/esphome-docs) with documentation (if applicable):** esphome/esphome-docs#<esphome-docs PR number goes here>\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n  - [x] The code change is tested and works locally.\r\n  - [ ] Tests have been added to verify that the new code works (under `tests/` folder).\r\n\r\nIf user exposed functionality or configuration variables are added/changed:\r\n  - [ ] Documentation added/updated in [esphome-docs](https://github.com/esphome/esphome-docs).\r\n",

ESP scans for new networks again\r\n - When connecting to \"Open Network\", I see the message `Potential Authmode downgrade detected, disconnecting..`, even though it's not this attack, and disconnects. The second time it tries to connect it works though.\r\n\r\nThis is because the code doesn't know if it was previously connected or not. I won't fix that at this time because it's a minor annoyance that few people will experience (having multiple networks with different auth mode is unlikely).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAlso, something's up with GH actions today, the `CI / test (test 1)` job is running on the \"Fix Typo\" commit, not the latest one.",

There are several\nprominent libraries for handling OAuth requests, but they all suffer from one or\nboth of the following:\n\n1. They predate the `OAuth 1.0 spec`_, AKA RFC 5849.\n2. They predate the `OAuth 2.0 spec`_, AKA RFC 6749.\n3. They assume the usage of a specific HTTP request library.\n\n.. _`OAuth 1.0 spec`: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849\n.. _`OAuth 2.0 spec`: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749\n\nOAuthLib is a framework which implements the logic of OAuth1 or OAuth2 without\nassuming a specific HTTP request object or web framework. Use it to graft OAuth\nclient support onto your favorite HTTP library, or provide support onto your\nfavourite web framework. If you're a maintainer of such a library, write a thin\nveneer on top of OAuthLib and get OAuth support for very little effort.\n\n\nDocumentation\n--------------\n\nFull documentation is available on `Read the Docs`_. All contributions are very\nwelcome! The documentation is still quite sparse, please open an issue for what\nyou'd like to know, or discuss it in our `Gitter community`_, or even better, send a\npull request!\n\n.. _`Gitter community`: https://gitter.im/oauthlib/Lobby\n.. _`Read the Docs`: https://oauthlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html\n\nInterested in making OAuth requests?\n------------------------------------\n\nThen you might be more interested in using `requests`_ which has OAuthLib\npowered OAuth support provided by the `requests-oauthlib`_ library.\n\n.. _`requests`: https://github.com/requests/requests\n.. _`requests-oauthlib`: https://github.com/requests/requests-oauthlib\n\nWhich web frameworks are supported?\n-----------------------------------\n\nThe following packages provide OAuth support using OAuthLib.\n\n- For Django there is `django-oauth-toolkit`_, which includes `Django REST framework`_ support.\n- For Flask there is `flask-oauthlib`_ and `Flask-Dance`_.\n- For Pyramid there is `pyramid-oauthlib`_.\n- For Bottle there is `bottle-oauthlib`_.\n\nIf you have written an OAuthLib package that supports your favorite framework,\nplease open a Pull Request, updating the documentation.\n\n.. _`django-oauth-toolkit`: https://github.com/evonove/django-oauth-toolkit\n.. _`flask-oauthlib`: https://github.com/lepture/flask-oauthlib\n.. _`Django REST framework`: http://django-rest-framework.org\n.. _`Flask-Dance`: https://github.com/singingwolfboy/flask-dance\n.. _`pyramid-oauthlib`: https://github.com/tilgovi/pyramid-oauthlib\n.. _`bottle-oauthlib`: https://github.com/thomsonreuters/bottle-oauthlib\n\nUsing OAuthLib? Please get in touch!\n------------------------------------\nPatching OAuth support onto an http request framework? Creating an OAuth\nprovider extension for a web framework? Simply using OAuthLib to Get Things Done\nor to learn?\n\nNo matter which we'd love to hear from you in our `Gitter community`_ or if you have\nanything in particular you would like to have, change or comment on don't\nhesitate for a second to send a pull request or open an issue.

We test every combination of PyTorch and Python supported versions, every OS, multi GPUs and even TPUs.\n- Minimal running speed overhead (about 300 ms per epoch compared with pure PyTorch).\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n    <a href=\"https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/\">Read the PyTorch Lightning docs</a>\n</div>\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n# Lightning Fabric: Expert control\n\nRun on any device at any scale with expert-level control over PyTorch training loop and scaling strategy.

This project provides an enterprise database connectivity option for the Django Web Framework, with support for Microsoft SQL Server and Azure SQL Database.\n\nWe'd like to give thanks to the community that made this project possible, with particular recognition of the contributors: OskarPersson, michiya, dlo and the original Google Code django-pyodbc team. Moving forward we encourage partipation in this project from both old and new contributors!\n\nWe hope you enjoy using the MSSQL-Django 3rd party backend.\n\n## Features\n\n-  Supports Django 3.2, 4.0, 4.1, 4.2 and 5.0\n-  Tested on Microsoft SQL Server 2016, 2017, 2019, 2022\n-  Passes most of the tests of the Django test suite\n-  Compatible with\n   [Micosoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/microsoft-odbc-driver-for-sql-server),\n   [SQL Server Native Client](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms131321(v=sql.120).aspx),\n   and [FreeTDS](https://www.freetds.org/) ODBC drivers\n\n## Dependencies\n\n-  pyodbc 3.0 or newer\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Install pyodbc 3.0 (or newer) and Django\n2. Install mssql-django:\n\n       pip install mssql-django\n\n3. Set the `ENGINE` setting in the `settings.py` file used by\n   your Django application or project to `'mssql'`:\n\n       'ENGINE': 'mssql'\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Standard Django settings\n\nThe following entries in a database-level settings dictionary\nin DATABASES control the behavior of the backend:\n\n-  ENGINE\n\n   String. It must be `\"mssql\"`.\n\n-  NAME\n\n   String. Database name. Required.\n\n-  HOST\n\n   String. SQL Server instance in `\"server\\instance\"` format.\n\n-  PORT\n\n   String. Server instance port.\n   An empty string means the default port.\n\n-  USER\n\n   String. Database user name in `\"user\"` format.\n   If not given then MS Integrated Security will be used.\n\n-  PASSWORD\n\n   String. Database user password.\n\n-  TOKEN\n\n   String. Access token fetched as a user or service principal which\n   has access to the database. E.g. when using `azure.identity`, the\n   result of `DefaultAzureCredential().get_token('https://database.windows.net/.default')`\n   can be passed.\n\n-  AUTOCOMMIT\n\n   Boolean. Set this to `False` if you want to disable\n   Django's transaction management and implement your own.\n\n-  Trusted_Connection\n\n   String. Default is `\"yes\"`. Can be set to `\"no\"` if required.\n\nand the following entries are also available in the `TEST` dictionary\nfor any given database-level settings dictionary:\n\n-  NAME\n\n   String. The name of database to use when running the test suite.\n   If the default value (`None`) is used, the test database will use\n   the name `\"test_\" + NAME`.\n\n-  COLLATION\n\n   String. The collation order to use when creating the test database.\n   If the default value (`None`) is used, the test database is assigned\n   the default collation of the instance of SQL Server.\n\n-  DEPENDENCIES\n\n   String. The creation-order dependencies of the database.\n   See the official Django documentation for more details.\n\n-  MIRROR\n\n   String. The alias of the database that this database should\n   mirror during testing. Default value is `None`.\n   See the official Django documentation for more details.\n\n### OPTIONS\n\nDictionary. Current available keys are:\n\n-  driver\n\n   String. ODBC Driver to use (`\"ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server\"`,\n   `\"SQL Server Native Client 11.0\"`, `\"FreeTDS\"` etc).\n   Default is `\"ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server\"`.\n\n-  isolation_level\n\n   String. Sets [transaction isolation level](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/set-transaction-isolation-level-transact-sql)\n   for each database session. Valid values for this entry are\n   `READ UNCOMMITTED`, `READ COMMITTED`, `REPEATABLE READ`,\n   `SNAPSHOT`, and `SERIALIZABLE`. Default is `None` which means\n   no isolation level is set to a database session and SQL Server default\n   will be used.\n\n-  dsn\n\n   String. A named DSN can be used instead of `HOST`.\n\n-  host_is_server\n\n   Boolean. Only relevant if using the FreeTDS ODBC driver under\n   Unix/Linux.\n\n   By default, when using the FreeTDS ODBC driver the value specified in\n   the ``HOST`` setting is used in a ``SERVERNAME`` ODBC connection\n   string component instead of being used in a ``SERVER`` component;\n   this means that this value should be the name of a *dataserver*\n   definition present in the ``freetds.conf`` FreeTDS configuration file\n   instead of a hostname or an IP address.\n\n   But if this option is present and its value is ``True``, this\n   special behavior is turned off. Instead, connections to the database\n   server will be established using ``HOST`` and ``PORT`` options, without\n   requiring ``freetds.conf`` to be configured.\n\n   See https://www.freetds.org/userguide/dsnless.html for more information.\n\n-  unicode_results\n\n   Boolean. If it is set to ``True``, pyodbc's *unicode_results* feature\n   is activated and strings returned from pyodbc are always Unicode.\n   Default value is ``False``.\n\n-  extra_params\n\n   String. Additional parameters for the ODBC connection. The format is\n   ``\"param=value;param=value\"``, [Azure AD Authentication](https://github.com/microsoft/mssql-django/wiki/Azure-AD-Authentication) (Service Principal, Interactive, Msi) can be added to this field.\n\n-  collation\n\n   String. Name of the collation to use when performing text field\n   lookups against the database. Default is ``None``; this means no\n   collation specifier is added to your lookup SQL (the default\n   collation of your database will be used). For Chinese language you\n   can set it to ``\"Chinese_PRC_CI_AS\"``.\n\n-  connection_timeout\n\n   Integer. Sets the timeout in seconds for the database connection process.\n   Default value is ``0`` which disables the timeout.\n\n-  connection_retries\n\n   Integer. Sets the times to retry the database connection process.\n   Default value is ``5``.\n\n-  connection_retry_backoff_time\n\n   Integer. Sets the back off time in seconds for reries of\n   the database connection process. Default value is ``5``.\n\n-  query_timeout\n\n   Integer. Sets the timeout in seconds for the database query.\n   Default value is ``0`` which disables the timeout.\n\n- [setencoding](https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc/wiki/Connection#setencoding) and [setdecoding](https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc/wiki/Connection#setdecoding)\n\n    ```python\n    # Example\n    \"OPTIONS\": {\n            \"setdecoding\": [\n                {\"sqltype\": pyodbc.SQL_CHAR, \"encoding\": 'utf-8'},\n                {\"sqltype\": pyodbc.SQL_WCHAR, \"encoding\": 'utf-8'}],\n            \"setencoding\": [\n                {\"encoding\": \"utf-8\"}],\n            ...\n            },\n    ```\n\n- return_rows_bulk_insert\n\n  Boolean. Sets if backend can return rows from bulk insert.\n  Default value is False which doesn't allows for the backend to\n  return rows from bulk insert. Must be set to False if database\n  has tables with triggers to prevent errors when inserting.\n\n  ```python\n  # Examples\n  \"OPTIONS\": {\n      # This database doesn't have any triggers so can use return\n      # rows from bulk insert feature\n      \"return_rows_bulk_insert\": True\n  }\n\n  \"OPTIONS\": {\n      # This database has triggers so leave return_rows_bulk_insert as blank (False)\n      # to prevent errors related to inserting and returning rows from bulk insert\n  }\n  ```\n\n### Backend-specific settings\n\nThe following project-level settings also control the behavior of the backend:\n\n-  DATABASE_CONNECTION_POOLING\n\n   Boolean. If it is set to ``False``, pyodbc's connection pooling feature\n   won't be activated.\n\n### Example\n\nHere is an example of the database settings:\n\n```python\n    DATABASES = {\n        'default': {\n            'ENGINE': 'mssql',\n            'NAME': 'mydb',\n            'USER': 'user@myserver',\n            'PASSWORD': 'password',\n            'HOST': 'myserver.database.windows.net',\n            'PORT': '',\n\n            'OPTIONS': {\n                'driver': 'ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server',\n            },\n        },\n    }\n\n    # set this to False if you want to turn off pyodbc's connection pooling\n    DATABASE_CONNECTION_POOLING = False\n```\n\n## Limitations\n\nThe following features are currently not fully supported:\n- Altering a model field from or to AutoField at migration\n- Django annotate functions have floating point arithmetic problems in some cases\n- Annotate function with exists\n- Exists function in order_by\n- Righthand power and arithmetic with datatimes\n- Timezones, timedeltas not fully supported\n- Rename field/model with foreign key constraint\n- Database level constraints\n- Filtered index\n- Date extract function\n- Bulk insert into a table with a trigger and returning the rows inserted\n\nJSONField lookups have limitations, more details [here](https://github.com/microsoft/mssql-django/wiki/JSONField).\n\n## Contributing\n\nMore details on contributing can be found [here](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nThis project welcomes contributions and suggestions.

If you find\nyourself jumping through hoops to allow your site administrators to do lots of\nthings, you're probably outside the use cases. Either trust those users, or\ndon't.\n\nBecause it relies on html5lib_, Bleach is as good as modern browsers at dealing\nwith weird, quirky HTML fragments. And *any* of Bleach's methods will fix\nunbalanced or mis-nested tags.\n\nThe version on GitHub_ is the most up-to-date and contains the latest bug\nfixes. You can find full documentation on `ReadTheDocs`_.\n\n:Code:           https://github.com/mozilla/bleach\n:Documentation:  https://bleach.readthedocs.io/\n:Issue tracker:  https://github.com/mozilla/bleach/issues\n:License:        Apache License v2; see LICENSE file\n\n\nReporting Bugs\n==============\n\nFor regular bugs, please report them `in our issue tracker\n<https://github.com/mozilla/bleach/issues>`_.\n\nIf you believe that you've found a security vulnerability, please `file a secure\nbug report in our bug tracker\n<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?assigned_to=nobody%40mozilla.org&product=Webtools&component=Bleach-security&groups=webtools-security>`_\nor send an email to *security AT mozilla DOT org*.\n\nFor more information on security-related bug disclosure and the PGP key to use\nfor sending encrypted mail or to verify responses received from that address,\nplease read our wiki page at\n`<https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/#For_Developers>`_.\n\n\nSecurity\n========\n\nBleach is a security-focused library.\n\nWe have a responsible security vulnerability reporting process. Please use\nthat if you're reporting a security issue.\n\nSecurity issues are fixed in private. After we land such a fix, we'll do a\nrelease.\n\nFor every release, we mark security issues we've fixed in the ``CHANGES`` in\nthe **Security issues** section. We include any relevant CVE links.\n\n\nInstalling Bleach\n=================\n\nBleach is available on PyPI_, so you can install it with ``pip``::\n\n    $ pip install bleach\n\n\nUpgrading Bleach\n================\n\n.. warning::\n\n   Before doing any upgrades, read through `Bleach Changes\n   <https://bleach.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changes.html>`_ for backwards\n   incompatible changes, newer versions, etc.\n\n   Bleach follows `semver 2`_ versioning. Vendored libraries will not\n   be changed in patch releases.\n\n\nBasic use\n=========\n\nThe simplest way to use Bleach is:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    >>> import bleach\n\n    >>> bleach.clean('an <script>evil()</script> example')\n    u'an &lt;script&gt;evil()&lt;/script&gt; example'\n\n    >>> bleach.linkify('an http://example.com url')\n    u'an <a href=\"http://example.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://example.com</a> url'\n\n\nCode of Conduct\n===============\n\nThis project and repository is governed by Mozilla's code of conduct and\netiquette guidelines.

                "body": "This was originally filed to the [security bug tracker](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1566541) but it was decided this is not within the security threat model of the library.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\nI decided to start work on a PR for the Bleach issue concerning localized domains (https://github.com/mozilla/bleach/issues/368). When building test-cases, I decided to generate one for \"punycode attacks\" aka [IDN Homograph Attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDN_homograph_attack) when unicode lookalike/homoglyph characters are replaced in a link text.\r\n\r\nThis allows a malicious attacker to create a link to a lookalike domain name.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n    googƒ∫e.com\txn--googe-95a.com\r\n    wikipedi–∞.org wikipedi\\u0430.org\r\n\r\n    print linkify(\"http://googƒ∫e.com\")\r\n    print linkify(\"http://wikipedi–∞.org\")\r\n\r\nModern browsers defend against this somewhat by customizing what appears in the display bar once it is clicked; however they do not control (to my knowledge) what happens on the page.\r\n\r\nActual results:\r\n\r\n    print linkify(\"foo http://googƒ∫e.com bar\")\r\n    foo <a href=\"http://googƒ∫e.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://googƒ∫e.com</a> bar\r\n\r\n    print linkify(\"foo http://wikipedi–∞.org bar\")\r\n    foo <a href=\"http://wikipedi–∞.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://wikipedi–∞.org</a> bar\r\n\r\nExpected results:\r\n\r\nSince bleach is a security focused library, I think it should - be default - approach this situation how the strictest of modern browsers do, but allow for other use cases as this approach is very much tailored to \"English users\" and not the international community. I think a Boolean argument to linkify could be used to provide security by default, and allow non-english alphabet users the ability to opt-out.\r\n\r\nDefault: the HREF should be be the punycode version\r\n\r\n    <a href=\"http://xn--googe-95a.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://googƒ∫e.com</a>\r\n\r\nOptional Strict: Linkified Text is also punycode\r\n\r\n    <a href=\"http://xn--googe-95a.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://xn--googe-95a.com</a>\r\n\r\nOptional Loose: allow the text as-is and leave everything to the browser\r\n\r\n     <a href=\"http://googƒ∫e.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://googƒ∫e.com</a>\r\n\r\nThis functionality could also be implemented in a callback function, which would accept as input two arguments: the raw link and the context ('a' href value, 'a' node/display text,  bare html to be turned into an a tag).\r\n\r\nHandling this via a callback is IMHO the best option as it would allow for bleach to abandon the regex of locked-down TLDs that seems to create more issues than it solves, while allowing users to still lock them down if wanted.",

The Hub can offer notebook servers to a class of students, a corporate\ndata science workgroup, a scientific research project, or a high-performance\ncomputing group.\n\n## Technical overview\n\nThree main actors make up JupyterHub:\n\n- multi-user **Hub** (tornado process)\n- configurable http **proxy** (node-http-proxy)\n- multiple **single-user Jupyter notebook servers** (Python/Jupyter/tornado)\n\nBasic principles for operation are:\n\n- Hub launches a proxy.\n- The Proxy forwards all requests to Hub by default.\n- Hub handles login and spawns single-user servers on demand.\n- Hub configures proxy to forward URL prefixes to the single-user notebook\n  servers.\n\nJupyterHub also provides a\n[REST API][]\nfor administration of the Hub and its users.\n\n[rest api]: https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/rest-api.html\n\n## Installation\n\n### Check prerequisites\n\n- A Linux/Unix based system\n- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.8 or greater\n- [nodejs/npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)\n\n  - If you are using **`conda`**, the nodejs and npm dependencies will be installed for\n    you by conda.\n\n  - If you are using **`pip`**, install a recent version (at least 12.0) of\n    [nodejs/npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node).\n\n- If using the default PAM Authenticator, a [pluggable authentication module (PAM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluggable_authentication_module).\n- TLS certificate and key for HTTPS communication\n- Domain name\n\n### Install packages\n\n#### Using `conda`\n\nTo install JupyterHub along with its dependencies including nodejs/npm:\n\n```bash\nconda install -c conda-forge jupyterhub\n```\n\nIf you plan to run notebook servers locally, install JupyterLab or Jupyter notebook:\n\n```bash\nconda install jupyterlab\nconda install notebook\n```\n\n#### Using `pip`\n\nJupyterHub can be installed with `pip`, and the proxy with `npm`:\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g configurable-http-proxy\npython3 -m pip install jupyterhub\n```\n\nIf you plan to run notebook servers locally, you will need to install\n[JupyterLab or Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html):\n\n    python3 -m pip install --upgrade jupyterlab\n    python3 -m pip install --upgrade notebook\n\n### Run the Hub server\n\nTo start the Hub server, run the command:\n\n    jupyterhub\n\nVisit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser, and sign in with your system username and password.\n\n_Note_: To allow multiple users to sign in to the server, you will need to\nrun the `jupyterhub` command as a _privileged user_, such as root.\nThe [wiki](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/wiki/Using-sudo-to-run-JupyterHub-without-root-privileges)\ndescribes how to run the server as a _less privileged user_, which requires\nmore configuration of the system.\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe [Getting Started](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/index.html#getting-started) section of the\ndocumentation explains the common steps in setting up JupyterHub.\n\nThe [**JupyterHub tutorial**](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub-tutorial)\nprovides an in-depth video and sample configurations of JupyterHub.\n\n### Create a configuration file\n\nTo generate a default config file with settings and descriptions:\n\n    jupyterhub --generate-config\n\n### Start the Hub\n\nTo start the Hub on a specific url and port `10.0.1.2:443` with **https**:\n\n    jupyterhub --ip 10.0.1.2 --port 443 --ssl-key my_ssl.key --ssl-cert my_ssl.cert\n\n### Authenticators\n\n| Authenticator

JupyterHub**](https://quay.io/repository/jupyterhub/jupyterhub)\ngives a baseline deployment of JupyterHub using Docker.\n\n**Important:** This `quay.io/jupyterhub/jupyterhub` image contains only the Hub itself,\nwith no configuration. In general, one needs to make a derivative image, with\nat least a `jupyterhub_config.py` setting up an Authenticator and/or a Spawner.\nTo run the single-user servers, which may be on the same system as the Hub or\nnot, Jupyter Notebook version 4 or greater must be installed.\n\nThe JupyterHub docker image can be started with the following command:\n\n    docker run -p 8000:8000 -d --name jupyterhub quay.io/jupyterhub/jupyterhub jupyterhub\n\nThis command will create a container named `jupyterhub` that you can\n**stop and resume** with `docker stop/start`.\n\nThe Hub service will be listening on all interfaces at port 8000, which makes\nthis a good choice for **testing JupyterHub on your desktop or laptop**.\n\nIf you want to run docker on a computer that has a public IP then you should\n(as in MUST) **secure it with ssl** by adding ssl options to your docker\nconfiguration or by using an ssl enabled proxy.\n\n[Mounting volumes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/volumes/volumes/) will\nallow you to **store data outside the docker image (host system) so it will be persistent**, even when you start\na new image.\n\nThe command `docker exec -it jupyterhub bash` will spawn a root shell in your docker\ncontainer. You can **use the root shell to create system users in the container**.\nThese accounts will be used for authentication in JupyterHub's default configuration.\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you would like to contribute to the project, please read our\n[contributor documentation](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/content-contributor.html)\nand the [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md). The `CONTRIBUTING.md` file\nexplains how to set up a development installation, how to run the test suite,\nand how to contribute to documentation.\n\nFor a high-level view of the vision and next directions of the project, see the\n[JupyterHub community roadmap](docs/source/contributing/roadmap.md).\n\n### A note about platform support\n\nJupyterHub is supported on Linux/Unix based systems.\n\nJupyterHub officially **does not** support Windows. You may be able to use\nJupyterHub on Windows if you use a Spawner and Authenticator that work on\nWindows, but the JupyterHub defaults will not. Bugs reported on Windows will not\nbe accepted, and the test suite will not run on Windows. Small patches that fix\nminor Windows compatibility issues (such as basic installation) **may** be accepted,\nhowever. For Windows-based systems, we would recommend running JupyterHub in a\ndocker container or Linux VM.\n\n[Additional Reference:](http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/#installation) Tornado's documentation on Windows platform support\n\n## License\n\nWe use a shared copyright model that enables all contributors to maintain the\ncopyright on their contributions.\n\nAll code is licensed under the terms of the [revised BSD license](./COPYING.md).\n\n## Help and resources\n\nWe encourage you to ask questions and share ideas on the [Jupyter community forum](https://discourse.jupyter.org/).\nYou can also talk with us on our JupyterHub [Gitter](https://gitter.im/jupyterhub/jupyterhub) channel.\n\n- [Reporting Issues](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/issues)\n- [JupyterHub tutorial](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub-tutorial)\n- [Documentation for JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n- [Documentation for JupyterHub's REST API][rest api]\n- [Documentation for Project Jupyter](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)\n- [Project Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org)\n- [Project Jupyter community](https://jupyter.org/community)\n\nJupyterHub follows the Jupyter [Community Guides](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/community/content-community.html).\n\n---\n\n**[Technical Overview](#technical-overview)** |\n**[Installation](#installation)** |\n**[Configuration](#configuration)** |\n**[Docker](#docker)** |\n**[Contributing](#contributing)** |\n**[License](#license)** |\n**[Help and Resources](#help-and-resources)**\n",

It includes **an integrated\ncommand line client**, has support for both **HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2**, and provides both **sync\nand async APIs**.\n\n---\n\nInstall HTTPX using pip:\n\n```shell\n$ pip install httpx\n```\n\nNow, let's get started:\n\n```pycon\n>>> import httpx\n>>> r = httpx.get('https://www.example.org/')\n>>> r\n<Response [200 OK]>\n>>> r.status_code\n200\n>>> r.headers['content-type']\n'text/html; charset=UTF-8'\n>>> r.text\n'<!doctype html>\\n<html>\\n<head>\\n<title>Example Domain</title>...'\n```\n\nOr, using the command-line client.\n\n```shell\n$ pip install 'httpx[cli]'  # The command line client is an optional dependency.\n```\n\nWhich now allows us to use HTTPX directly from the command-line...\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img width=\"700\" src=\"docs/img/httpx-help.png\" alt='httpx --help'>\n</p>\n\nSending a request...\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img width=\"700\" src=\"docs/img/httpx-request.png\" alt='httpx http://httpbin.org/json'>\n</p>\n\n## Features\n\nHTTPX builds on the well-established usability of `requests`, and gives you:\n\n* A broadly [requests-compatible API](https://www.python-httpx.org/compatibility/).\n* An integrated command-line client.\n* HTTP/1.1 [and HTTP/2 support](https://www.python-httpx.org/http2/).\n* Standard synchronous interface, but with [async support if you need it](https://www.python-httpx.org/async/).\n* Ability to make requests directly to [WSGI applications](https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/transports/#wsgi-transport) or [ASGI applications](https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/transports/#asgi-transport).\n* Strict timeouts everywhere.\n* Fully type annotated.\n* 100% test coverage.\n\nPlus all the standard features of `requests`...\n\n* International Domains and URLs\n* Keep-Alive & Connection Pooling\n* Sessions with Cookie Persistence\n* Browser-style SSL Verification\n* Basic/Digest Authentication\n* Elegant Key/Value Cookies\n* Automatic Decompression\n* Automatic Content Decoding\n* Unicode Response Bodies\n* Multipart File Uploads\n* HTTP(S) Proxy Support\n* Connection Timeouts\n* Streaming Downloads\n* .netrc Support\n* Chunked Requests\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall with pip:\n\n```shell\n$ pip install httpx\n```\n\nOr, to include the optional HTTP/2 support, use:\n\n```shell\n$ pip install httpx[http2]\n```\n\nHTTPX requires Python 3.8+.\n\n## Documentation\n\nProject documentation is available at [https://www.python-httpx.org/](https://www.python-httpx.org/).\n\nFor a run-through of all the basics, head over to the [QuickStart](https://www.python-httpx.org/quickstart/).\n\nFor more advanced topics, see the [Advanced Usage](https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/) section, the [async support](https://www.python-httpx.org/async/) section, or the [HTTP/2](https://www.python-httpx.org/http2/) section.\n\nThe [Developer Interface](https://www.python-httpx.org/api/) provides a comprehensive API reference.\n\nTo find out about tools that integrate with HTTPX, see [Third Party Packages](https://www.python-httpx.org/third_party_packages/).\n\n## Contribute\n\nIf you want to contribute with HTTPX check out the [Contributing Guide](https://www.python-httpx.org/contributing/) to learn how to start.\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThe HTTPX project relies on these excellent libraries:\n\n* `httpcore` - The underlying transport implementation for `httpx`.\n  * `h11` - HTTP/1.1 support.\n* `certifi` - SSL certificates.\n* `idna` - Internationalized domain name support.\n* `sniffio` - Async library autodetection.\n\nAs well as these optional installs:\n\n* `h2` - HTTP/2 support. *(Optional, with `httpx[http2]`)*\n* `socksio` - SOCKS proxy support. *(Optional, with `httpx[socks]`)*\n* `rich` - Rich terminal support. *(Optional, with `httpx[cli]`)*\n* `click` - Command line client support. *(Optional, with `httpx[cli]`)*\n* `brotli` or `brotlicffi` - Decoding for \"brotli\" compressed responses. *(Optional, with `httpx[brotli]`)*\n* `zstandard` - Decoding for \"zstd\" compressed responses. *(Optional, with `httpx[zstd]`)*\n\nA huge amount of credit is due to `requests` for the API layout that\nmuch of this work follows, as well as to `urllib3` for plenty of design\ninspiration around the lower-level networking details.\n\n---\n\n<p align=\"center\"><i>HTTPX is <a href=\"https://github.com/encode/httpx/blob/master/LICENSE.md\">BSD licensed</a> code.<br/>Designed & crafted with care.</i><br/>&mdash; ü¶ã &mdash;</p>\n",

Alternatively, you may email\n[security@palletsprojects.com](mailto:security@palletsprojects.com), and we will\nconvert that to a GitHub security advisory.\n\nBe sure to include as much detail as necessary in your report. As with reporting\nnormal issues, a minimal reproducible example will help the maintainers address\nthe issue faster. Information about why the issue is a security issue is also\nhelpful. If you are able, you may also provide a fix for the issue.\n\nA maintainer will reply acknowledging the report and how to continue. We will\nobtain a CVE id as well, please do not do this on your own. We will work with\nyou to attempt to understand the issue and decide on its validity. Maintainers\nare volunteers working in their free time, and therefore cannot guarantee any\nspecific timeline. Please be patient during this process.\n\nThe current feature release will receive security fixes. Fixes to older versions\nmay be considered based on usage information and severity, but are not\nguaranteed. After fixing an issue, we will make a new release.\n\n[gh-docs]: https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/creating-a-repository-security-advisory\n",

Thus boosting the security of your\nexisting applications.\n\nOverview\n========\n\nprivacyIDEA runs as an additional service in your network and you can connect different\napplications to privacyIDEA.\n\n.. image:: https://privacyidea.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/privacyIDEA-Integration.png\n    :alt: privacyIDEA Integration\n\nprivacyIDEA does not bind you to any decision of the authentication\nprotocol, nor does it dictate you where your user information should be\nstored. This is achieved by its totally modular architecture.\nprivacyIDEA is not only open as far as its modular architecture is\nconcerned. But privacyIDEA is completely licensed under the AGPLv3.\n\nIt supports a wide variety of authentication devices like OTP tokens\n(HMAC, HOTP, TOTP, OCRA, mOTP), Yubikey (HOTP, TOTP, AES), FIDO U2F, as well\nas FIDO2 WebAuthn devices like Yubikey and Plug-Up, smartphone Apps like Google\nAuthenticator, FreeOTP, Token2  or TiQR, SMS, Email, SSH keys, x509 certificates\nand Registration Codes for easy deployment.\n\nprivacyIDEA is based on Flask and SQLAlchemy as the python backend. The\nweb UI is based on angularJS and bootstrap.\nA MachineToken design lets you assign tokens to machines. Thus you can use\nyour Yubikey to unlock LUKS, assign SSH keys to SSH servers or use Offline OTP\nwith PAM.\n\nYou may join the discourse discussion forum to give feedback, help other users,\ndiscuss questions and ideas:\nhttps://community.privacyidea.org\n\n\nSetup\n=====\n\nFor setting up the system to *run* it, please read install instructions\nat `privacyidea.readthedocs.io <http://privacyidea.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/index\n.html>`_.\n\nIf you want to setup a development environment start like this::\n\n    git clone https://github.com/privacyidea/privacyidea.git\n    cd privacyidea\n    virtualenv venv\n    source venv/bin/activate\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\n\n.. _testing_env:\n\nYou may additionally want to set up your environment for testing, by adding the\nadditional dependencies::\n\n    pip install -r tests/requirements.txt\n\nYou may also want to read the blog post about development and debugging at\nhttps://www.privacyidea.org/privacyidea-development-howto/\n\nGetting and updating submodules\n===============================\n\nThe client-side library for the registering and signing of WebAuthn-Credentials\nresides in a submodule.\n\nTo fetch all submodules for this repository, run::\n\n   git submodule update --init --recursive\n\nWhen pulling changes from upstream later, you can automatically update any outdated\nsubmodules, by running::\n\n   git pull --recurse-submodules\n\nRunning it\n==========\n\nFirst You need to create a `config-file <https://privacyidea.readthedocs\n.io/en/latest/installation/system/inifile.html>`_.\n\nThen create the database tables and the encryption key::\n\n    ./pi-manage create_tables\n    ./pi-manage create_enckey\n\nIf You want to keep the development database upgradable, You should `stamp\n<https://privacyidea.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/upgrade.html>`_ it\nto simplify updates::\n\n    ./pi-manage db stamp head -d migrations/\n\nCreate the key for the audit log::\n\n    ./pi-manage create_audit_keys\n\nCreate the first administrator::\n\n    ./pi-manage admin add <username>\n\nRun it::\n\n    ./pi-manage run\n\nNow you can connect to http://localhost:5000 with your browser and login\nas administrator.\n\nRun tests\n=========\n\nIf you have followed the steps above to set up your\n`environment for testing <#testing-env>`__, running the test suite should be as\neasy as running `pytest <http://pytest.org/>`_ with the following options::\n\n    python -m pytest -v --cov=privacyidea --cov-report=html tests/\n\nContributing\n============\n\nThere are a lot of different ways to contribute to privacyIDEA, even\nif you are not a developer.\n\nIf you found a security vulnerability please report it to\nsecurity@privacyidea.org.\n\nYou can find detailed information about contributing here:\nhttps://github.com/privacyidea/privacyidea/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n\nCode structure\n==============\n\nThe database models are defined in ``models.py`` and tested in\ntests/test_db_model.py.\n\nBased on the database models there are the libraries ``lib/config.py`` which is\nresponsible for basic configuration in the database table ``config``.\nAnd the library ``lib/resolver.py`` which provides functions for the database\ntable ``resolver``. This is tested in tests/test_lib_resolver.py.\n\nBased on the resolver there is the library ``lib/realm.py`` which provides\nfunctions\nfor the database table ``realm``. Several resolvers are combined into a realm.\n\nBased on the realm there is the library ``lib/user.py`` which provides functions\nfor users. There is no database table user, since users are dynamically read\nfrom the user sources like SQL, LDAP, SCIM or flat files.\n\nSubscriptions and limitations of community edition\n==================================================\n\nUsing privacyIDEA Server and the privacyIDEA FreeRADIUS plugin there is technically no\nlimitation of the community edition or the code in this repository.\nAdmins will receive a welcome message about possible support, if more than 50 users\nare enrolled.\n\nPlugins\n-------\n\nThe privacyIDEA project also provides several plugins for 3rd party applications like SSO Identity Providers\nor Windows Login.\n\nPlugins can be limited in the number of users. I.e. the plugin will complain, if the total number of users\nin privacyIDEA with an active token exceeds a certain limit. There is a certain base number of users, with which\nthe plugin will work. To enhance this number, you will need a subscription. In some cases an additional\ndemo subscription can be found in the release list of the corresponding github plugin repository,\nyou can get a subscription from the company NetKnights\nor if you have a very good understanding of this Open Source code, you could create a subscription on your own.\n\n====================  ==============  ========================\nPlugin                Number of users\n--------------------  ----------------------------------------\nName                  contained       in demo subscription\n====================  ==============  ========================\nKeycloak              10000           N/A\nSimpleSAMLphp         10000           N/A\nShibboleth            10000           N/A\nADFS                  50              50\nprivacyIDEA PAM       10000           N/A\nCredential Provider   50              50\nownCloud              50              N/A\nLDAP proxy            50              N/A\n====================  ==============  ========================\n\nVersioning\n==========\nprivacyIDEA adheres to `Semantic Versioning <http://semver.org/>`_.\n",

Unlike `ast` up to Python 3.7, the parsers in\n`typed_ast` include [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) type\ncomments and are independent of the version of Python under which they are run.\nThe `typed_ast` parsers produce the standard Python AST (plus type comments),\nand are both fast and correct, as they are based on the CPython 2.7 and 3.7\nparsers.  `typed_ast` runs on CPython 3.6-3.10 on Linux, OS X and Windows.\n\n**Note:** Starting with Python 3.8, we recommend to use the native `ast` parser\n(see below).\n\n## Development Philosophy\n\nThis project is a (mostly) drop-in replacement for the builtin `ast` module.  It is\nintended to be bug-for-bug compatible and behave identically, except for the\npresence of a few additional fields on the returned classes and a few\nadditional optional arguments to the `parse` call.  Therefore, `typed_ast` will\nnot accept any bugfixes for bugs in `ast` -- they should be fixed upstream\ninstead.  To avoid feature bloat, any new features for `typed_ast` should have\nthe potential to be broadly useful and not be built just for one niche usecase\nor in a manner such that only one project can use them.\n\n### Incompatibilities\n\nFor the purposes of *consuming* syntax trees, this should be a drop-in replacement.\nIt is not a drop-in replacement for users that wish to create or transform ASTs,\nas a number of syntax tree classes have additional fields that must be populated\nwhen constructing them.\n\nDue to reliance on certain C APIs, this library does not build on and there\nare [no plans to support PyPy](https://github.com/python/typed_ast/issues/111).\n\n### Python 3.8\n\n`typed_ast` will not be updated to support parsing Python 3.8 and\nnewer.  Instead, it is recommended to use the stdlib `ast` module\nthere, which has been augmented to support extracting type comments\nand has limited support for parsing older versions of Python 3.\n\n## Submodules\n### ast3\nThe `ast3` parser produces the AST from a Python 3 code, up to Python 3.7. \n(For rationale and technical\ndetails, see [here](update_process.md).)  The AST it currently produces is described in\n[ast3/Parser/Python.asdl](ast3/Parser/Python.asdl).  If you wish to limit\nparsing to older versions of Python 3, `ast3` can be configured to to give a\nSyntaxError for new syntax features introduced beyond a given Python version.\nFor more information, see the module docstring in\n[typed\\_ast/ast3.py](typed_ast/ast3.py).\n\n### ast27\nThe `ast27` parser tracks the standard Python 2.7 AST, which is expected to\nnever receive further updates. The AST it produces is described in\n[ast27/Parser/Python.asdl](ast27/Parser/Python.asdl).  For more information,\nsee the module docstring in [typed\\_ast/ast27.py](typed_ast/ast27.py).\n\n### conversions\n`typed_ast` also provides a `conversions` module which converts `ast27` ASTs\ninto `ast3` ASTs.  This functionality is somewhat experimental, however.  For\nmore information, see the `py2to3` docstring in\n[typed\\_ast/conversions](typed_ast/conversions.py).\n\n\nNote: as these parsers consider type comments part of the grammar, incorrectly\nplaced type comments are considered syntax errors.\n\n## Releases\n\nTo make a new `typed_ast` release, see [`release_process.md`](release_process.md).\n",

DOMPurify was [started in February 2014](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/commit/a630922616927373485e0e787ab19e73e3691b2b) and, meanwhile, has reached version **v3.1.7**.\n\nDOMPurify is written in JavaScript and works in all modern browsers (Safari (10+), Opera (15+), Edge, Firefox and Chrome - as well as almost anything else using Blink, Gecko or WebKit). It doesn't break on MSIE or other legacy browsers. It simply does nothing.\n\n**Note that [DOMPurify v2.5.7](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/releases/tag/2.5.7) is the latest version supporting MSIE. For important security updates compatible with MSIE, please use the [2.x branch](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/tree/2.x).**\n\nOur automated tests cover [19 different browsers](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/blob/main/test/karma.custom-launchers.config.js#L5) right now, more to come. We also cover Node.js v16.x, v17.x, v18.x and v19.x, running DOMPurify on [jsdom](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom). Older Node versions are known to work as well, but hey... no guarantees.\n\nDOMPurify is written by security people who have vast background in web attacks and XSS. Fear not. For more details please also read about our [Security Goals & Threat Model](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/wiki/Security-Goals-&-Threat-Model). Please, read it. Like, really.\n\n## What does it do?\n\nDOMPurify sanitizes HTML and prevents XSS attacks. You can feed DOMPurify with string full of dirty HTML and it will return a string (unless configured otherwise) with clean HTML. DOMPurify will strip out everything that contains dangerous HTML and thereby prevent XSS attacks and other nastiness. It's also damn bloody fast. We use the technologies the browser provides and turn them into an XSS filter. The faster your browser, the faster DOMPurify will be.\n\n## How do I use it?\n\nIt's easy. Just include DOMPurify on your website.\n\n### Using the unminified development version\n\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"src/purify.js\"></script>\n```\n\n### Using the minified and tested production version (source-map available)\n\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"dist/purify.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nAfterwards you can sanitize strings by executing the following code:\n\n```js\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty);\n```\n\nOr maybe this, if you love working with Angular or alike:\n\n```js\nimport DOMPurify from 'dompurify';\n\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize('<b>hello there</b>');\n```\n\nThe resulting HTML can be written into a DOM element using `innerHTML` or the DOM using `document.write()`. That is fully up to you.\nNote that by default, we permit HTML, SVG **and** MathML. If you only need HTML, which might be a very common use-case, you can easily set that up as well:\n\n```js\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, { USE_PROFILES: { html: true } });\n```\n\n### Is there any foot-gun potential?\n\nWell, please note, if you _first_ sanitize HTML and then modify it _afterwards_, you might easily **void the effects of sanitization**. If you feed the sanitized markup to another library _after_ sanitization, please be certain that the library doesn't mess around with the HTML on its own.\n\n### Okay, makes sense, let's move on\n\nAfter sanitizing your markup, you can also have a look at the property `DOMPurify.removed` and find out, what elements and attributes were thrown out. Please **do not use** this property for making any security critical decisions. This is just a little helper for curious minds.\n\n### Running DOMPurify on the server\n\nDOMPurify technically also works server-side with Node.js. Our support strives to follow the [Node.js release cycle](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/).\n\nRunning DOMPurify on the server requires a DOM to be present, which is probably no surprise. Usually, [jsdom](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom) is the tool of choice and we **strongly recommend** to use the latest version of _jsdom_.\n\nWhy? Because older versions of _jsdom_ are known to be buggy in ways that result in XSS _even if_ DOMPurify does everything 100% correctly. There are **known attack vectors** in, e.g. _jsdom v19.0.0_ that are fixed in _jsdom v20.0.0_ - and we really recommend to keep _jsdom_ up to date because of that.\n\nPlease also be aware that tools like [happy-dom](https://github.com/capricorn86/happy-dom) exist but **are not considered safe** at this point. Combining DOMPurify with _happy-dom_ is currently not recommended and will likely lead to XSS.\n\nOther than that, you are fine to use DOMPurify on the server. Probably. This really depends on _jsdom_ or whatever DOM you utilize server-side. If you can live with that, this is how you get it to work:\n\n```bash\nnpm install dompurify\nnpm install jsdom\n```\n\nFor _jsdom_ (please use an up-to-date version), this should do the trick:\n\n```js\nconst createDOMPurify = require('dompurify');\nconst { JSDOM } = require('jsdom');\n\nconst window = new JSDOM('').window;\nconst DOMPurify = createDOMPurify(window);\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize('<b>hello there</b>');\n```\n\nOr even this, if you prefer working with imports:\n\n```js\nimport { JSDOM } from 'jsdom';\nimport DOMPurify from 'dompurify';\n\nconst window = new JSDOM('').window;\nconst purify = DOMPurify(window);\nconst clean = purify.sanitize('<b>hello there</b>');\n```\n\nIf you have problems making it work in your specific setup, consider looking at the amazing [isomorphic-dompurify](https://github.com/kkomelin/isomorphic-dompurify) project which solves lots of problems people might run into.\n\n```bash\nnpm install isomorphic-dompurify\n```\n\n```js\nimport DOMPurify from 'isomorphic-dompurify';\n\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize('<s>hello</s>');\n```\n\n## Is there a demo?\n\nOf course there is a demo! [Play with DOMPurify](https://cure53.de/purify)\n\n## What if I find a _security_ bug?\n\nFirst of all, please immediately contact us via [email](mailto:mario@cure53.de) so we can work on a fix. [PGP key](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0xC26C858090F70ADA)\n\nAlso, you probably qualify for a bug bounty! The fine folks over at [Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com/) use DOMPurify for their services and added our library to their bug bounty scope. So, if you find a way to bypass or weaken DOMPurify, please also have a look at their website and the [bug bounty info](https://www.fastmail.com/about/bugbounty/).\n\n## Some purification samples please?\n\nHow does purified markup look like? Well, [the demo](https://cure53.de/purify) shows it for a big bunch of nasty elements. But let's also show some smaller examples!\n\n```js\nDOMPurify.sanitize('<img src=x onerror=alert(1)//>'); // becomes <img src=\"x\">\nDOMPurify.sanitize('<svg><g/onload=alert(2)//<p>'); // becomes <svg><g></g></svg>\nDOMPurify.sanitize('<p>abc<iframe//src=jAva&Tab;script:alert(3)>def</p>'); // becomes <p>abc</p>\nDOMPurify.sanitize('<math><mi//xlink:href=\"data:x,<script>alert(4)</script>\">'); // becomes <math><mi></mi></math>\nDOMPurify.sanitize('<TABLE><tr><td>HELLO</tr></TABL>'); // becomes <table><tbody><tr><td>HELLO</td></tr></tbody></table>\nDOMPurify.sanitize('<UL><li><A HREF=//google.com>click</UL>'); // becomes <ul><li><a href=\"//google.com\">click</a></li></ul>\n```\n\n## What is supported?\n\nDOMPurify currently supports HTML5, SVG and MathML. DOMPurify per default allows CSS, HTML custom data attributes. DOMPurify also supports the Shadow DOM - and sanitizes DOM templates recursively. DOMPurify also allows you to sanitize HTML for being used with the jQuery `$()` and `elm.html()` API without any known problems.\n\n## What about legacy browsers like Internet Explorer?\n\nDOMPurify does nothing at all. It simply returns exactly the string that you fed it. DOMPurify exposes a property called `isSupported`, which tells you whether it will be able to do its job, so you can come up with your own backup plan.\n\n## What about DOMPurify and Trusted Types?\n\nIn version 1.0.9, support for [Trusted Types API](https://github.com/w3c/webappsec-trusted-types) was added to DOMPurify.\nIn version 2.0.0, a config flag was added to control DOMPurify's behavior regarding this.\n\nWhen `DOMPurify.sanitize` is used in an environment where the Trusted Types API is available and `RETURN_TRUSTED_TYPE` is set to `true`, it tries to return a `TrustedHTML` value instead of a string (the behavior for `RETURN_DOM` and `RETURN_DOM_FRAGMENT` config options does not change).\n\nNote that in order to create a policy in `trustedTypes` using DOMPurify, `RETURN_TRUSTED_TYPE: false` is required, as `createHTML` expects a normal string, not `TrustedHTML`. The example below shows this.\n\n```js\nwindow.trustedTypes!.createPolicy('default', {\n  createHTML: (to_escape) =>\n    DOMPurify.sanitize(to_escape, { RETURN_TRUSTED_TYPE: false }),\n});\n```\n\n## Can I configure DOMPurify?\n\nYes. The included default configuration values are pretty good already - but you can of course override them. Check out the [`/demos`](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/tree/main/demos) folder to see a bunch of examples on how you can [customize DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/tree/main/demos#what-is-this).\n\n### General settings\n```js\n// strip {{ ... }}, ${ ... } and <% ... %> to make output safe for template systems\n// be careful please, this mode is not recommended for production usage.\n// allowing template parsing in user-controlled HTML is not advised at all.\n// only use this mode if there is really no alternative.\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {SAFE_FOR_TEMPLATES: true});\n\n\n// change how e.g. comments containing risky HTML characters are treated.\n// be very careful, this setting should only be set to `false` if you really only handle \n// HTML and nothing else, no SVG, MathML or the like. \n// Otherwise, changing from `true` to `false` will lead to XSS in this or some other way.\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {SAFE_FOR_XML: false});\n```\n\n### Control our allow-lists and block-lists\n```js\n// allow only <b> elements, very strict\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {ALLOWED_TAGS: ['b']});\n\n// allow only <b> and <q> with style attributes\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {ALLOWED_TAGS: ['b', 'q'], ALLOWED_ATTR: ['style']});\n\n// allow all safe HTML elements but neither SVG nor MathML\n// note that the USE_PROFILES setting will override the ALLOWED_TAGS setting\n// so don't use them together\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {USE_PROFILES: {html: true}});\n\n// allow all safe SVG elements and SVG Filters, no HTML or MathML\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {USE_PROFILES: {svg: true, svgFilters: true}});\n\n// allow all safe MathML elements and SVG, but no SVG Filters\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {USE_PROFILES: {mathMl: true, svg: true}});\n\n// change the default namespace from HTML to something different\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {NAMESPACE: 'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'});\n\n// leave all safe HTML as it is and add <style> elements to block-list\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {FORBID_TAGS: ['style']});\n\n// leave all safe HTML as it is and add style attributes to block-list\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {FORBID_ATTR: ['style']});\n\n// extend the existing array of allowed tags and add <my-tag> to allow-list\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {ADD_TAGS: ['my-tag']});\n\n// extend the existing array of allowed attributes and add my-attr to allow-list\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {ADD_ATTR: ['my-attr']});\n\n// prohibit ARIA attributes, leave other safe HTML as is (default is true)\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {ALLOW_ARIA_ATTR: false});\n\n// prohibit HTML5 data attributes, leave other safe HTML as is (default is true)\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {ALLOW_DATA_ATTR: false});\n```\n\n### Control behavior relating to Custom Elements\n```js\n// DOMPurify allows to define rules for Custom Elements. When using the CUSTOM_ELEMENT_HANDLING\n// literal, it is possible to define exactly what elements you wish to allow (by default, none are allowed).\n//\n// The same goes for their attributes. By default, the built-in or configured allow.list is used.\n//\n// You can use a RegExp literal to specify what is allowed or a predicate, examples for both can be seen below.\n// The default values are very restrictive to prevent accidental XSS bypasses. Handle with great care!\n\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(\n    '<foo-bar baz=\"foobar\" forbidden=\"true\"></foo-bar><div is=\"foo-baz\"></div>',\n    {\n        CUSTOM_ELEMENT_HANDLING: {\n            tagNameCheck: null, // no custom elements are allowed\n            attributeNameCheck: null, // default / standard attribute allow-list is used\n            allowCustomizedBuiltInElements: false, // no customized built-ins allowed\n        },\n    }\n); // <div is=\"\"></div>\n\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(\n    '<foo-bar baz=\"foobar\" forbidden=\"true\"></foo-bar><div is=\"foo-baz\"></div>',\n    {\n        CUSTOM_ELEMENT_HANDLING: {\n            tagNameCheck: /^foo-/, // allow all tags starting with \"foo-\"\n            attributeNameCheck: /baz/, // allow all attributes containing \"baz\"\n            allowCustomizedBuiltInElements: true, // customized built-ins are allowed\n        },\n    }\n); // <foo-bar baz=\"foobar\"></foo-bar><div is=\"foo-baz\"></div>\n\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(\n    '<foo-bar baz=\"foobar\" forbidden=\"true\"></foo-bar><div is=\"foo-baz\"></div>',\n    {\n        CUSTOM_ELEMENT_HANDLING: {\n            tagNameCheck: (tagName) => tagName.match(/^foo-/), // allow all tags starting with \"foo-\"\n            attributeNameCheck: (attr) => attr.match(/baz/), // allow all containing \"baz\"\n            allowCustomizedBuiltInElements: true, // allow customized built-ins\n        },\n    }\n); // <foo-bar baz=\"foobar\"></foo-bar><div is=\"foo-baz\"></div>\n```\n### Control behavior relating to URI values\n```js\n// extend the existing array of elements that can use Data URIs\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {ADD_DATA_URI_TAGS: ['a', 'area']});\n\n// extend the existing array of elements that are safe for URI-like values (be careful, XSS risk)\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {ADD_URI_SAFE_ATTR: ['my-attr']});\n\n```\n### Control permitted attribute values\n```js\n// allow external protocol handlers in URL attributes (default is false, be careful, XSS risk)\n// by default only http, https, ftp, ftps, tel, mailto, callto, sms, cid and xmpp are allowed.\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {ALLOW_UNKNOWN_PROTOCOLS: true});\n\n// allow specific protocols handlers in URL attributes via regex (default is false, be careful, XSS risk)\n// by default only http, https, ftp, ftps, tel, mailto, callto, sms, cid and xmpp are allowed.\n// Default RegExp: /^(?:(?:(?:f|ht)tps?|mailto|tel|callto|sms|cid|xmpp):|[^a-z]|[a-z+.\\-]+(?:[^a-z+.\\-:]|$))/i;\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {ALLOWED_URI_REGEXP: /^(?:(?:(?:f|ht)tps?|mailto|tel|callto|sms|cid|xmpp|xxx):|[^a-z]|[a-z+.\\-]+(?:[^a-z+.\\-:]|$))/i});\n\n```\n### Influence the return-type\n```js\n// return a DOM HTMLBodyElement instead of an HTML string (default is false)\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {RETURN_DOM: true});\n\n// return a DOM DocumentFragment instead of an HTML string (default is false)\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {RETURN_DOM_FRAGMENT: true});\n\n// use the RETURN_TRUSTED_TYPE flag to turn on Trusted Types support if available\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {RETURN_TRUSTED_TYPE: true}); // will return a TrustedHTML object instead of a string if possible\n\n// use a provided Trusted Types policy\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {\n    // supplied policy must define createHTML and createScriptURL\n    TRUSTED_TYPES_POLICY: trustedTypes.createPolicy({\n        createHTML(s) { return s},\n        createScriptURL(s) { return s},\n    }\n});\n```\n### Influence how we sanitize\n```js\n// return entire document including <html> tags (default is false)\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {WHOLE_DOCUMENT: true});\n\n// disable DOM Clobbering protection on output (default is true, handle with care, minor XSS risks here)\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {SANITIZE_DOM: false});\n\n// enforce strict DOM Clobbering protection via namespace isolation (default is false)\n// when enabled, isolates the namespace of named properties (i.e., `id` and `name` attributes)\n// from JS variables by prefixing them with the string `user-content-`\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {SANITIZE_NAMED_PROPS: true});\n\n// keep an element's content when the element is removed (default is true)\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {KEEP_CONTENT: false});\n\n// glue elements like style, script or others to document.body and prevent unintuitive browser behavior in several edge-cases (default is false)\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {FORCE_BODY: true});\n\n// remove all <a> elements under <p> elements that are removed\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {FORBID_CONTENTS: ['a'], FORBID_TAGS: ['p']});\n\n// change the parser type so sanitized data is treated as XML and not as HTML, which is the default\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {PARSER_MEDIA_TYPE: 'application/xhtml+xml'});\n```\n### Influence where we sanitize\n```js\n// use the IN_PLACE mode to sanitize a node \"in place\", which is much faster depending on how you use DOMPurify\nconst dirty = document.createElement('a');\ndirty.setAttribute('href', 'javascript:alert(1)');\n\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {IN_PLACE: true}); // see https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/issues/288 for more info\n```\n\nThere is even [more examples here](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/tree/main/demos#what-is-this), showing how you can run, customize and configure DOMPurify to fit your needs.\n\n## Persistent Configuration\n\nInstead of repeatedly passing the same configuration to `DOMPurify.sanitize`, you can use the `DOMPurify.setConfig` method. Your configuration will persist until your next call to `DOMPurify.setConfig`, or until you invoke `DOMPurify.clearConfig` to reset it. Remember that there is only one active configuration, which means once it is set, all extra configuration parameters passed to `DOMPurify.sanitize` are ignored.\n\n## Hooks\n\nDOMPurify allows you to augment its functionality by attaching one or more functions with the `DOMPurify.addHook` method to one of the following hooks:\n\n- `beforeSanitizeElements`\n- `uponSanitizeElement` (No 's' - called for every element)\n- `afterSanitizeElements`\n- `beforeSanitizeAttributes`\n- `uponSanitizeAttribute`\n- `afterSanitizeAttributes`\n- `beforeSanitizeShadowDOM`\n- `uponSanitizeShadowNode`\n- `afterSanitizeShadowDOM`\n\nIt passes the currently processed DOM node, when needed a literal with verified node and attribute data and the DOMPurify configuration to the callback. Check out the [MentalJS hook demo](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/blob/main/demos/hooks-mentaljs-demo.html) to see how the API can be used nicely.\n\n_Example_:\n\n```js\nDOMPurify.addHook(\n  'uponSanitizeAttribute',\n  function (currentNode, hookEvent, config) {\n    // Do something with the current node\n    // You can also mutate hookEvent for current node (i.e. set hookEvent.forceKeepAttr = true)\n    // For other than 'uponSanitizeAttribute' hook types hookEvent equals to null\n  }\n);\n```\n\n## Removed Configuration\n\n| Option          | Since | Note                     |\n|-----------------|-------|--------------------------|\n| SAFE_FOR_JQUERY | 2.1.0 | No replacement required. |\n\n## Continuous Integration\n\nWe are currently using Github Actions in combination with BrowserStack. This gives us the possibility to confirm for each and every commit that all is going according to plan in all supported browsers. Check out the build logs here: https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/actions\n\nYou can further run local tests by executing `npm test`. The tests work fine with Node.js v0.6.2 and jsdom@8.5.0.\n\nAll relevant commits will be signed with the key `0x24BB6BF4` for additional security (since 8th of April 2016).\n\n### Development and contributing\n\n#### Installation (`npm i`)\n\nWe support `npm` officially. GitHub Actions workflow is configured to install dependencies using `npm`. When using deprecated version of `npm` we can not fully ensure the versions of installed dependencies which might lead to unanticipated problems.\n\n#### Scripts\n\nWe rely on npm run-scripts for integrating with our tooling infrastructure. We use ESLint as a pre-commit hook to ensure code consistency. Moreover, to ease formatting we use [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) while building the `/dist` assets happens through `rollup`.\n\nThese are our npm scripts:\n\n- `npm run dev` to start building while watching sources for changes\n- `npm run test` to run our test suite via jsdom and karma\n  - `test:jsdom` to only run tests through jsdom\n  - `test:karma` to only run tests through karma\n- `npm run lint` to lint the sources using ESLint (via xo)\n- `npm run format` to format our sources using prettier to ease to pass ESLint\n- `npm run build` to build our distribution assets minified and unminified as a UMD module\n  - `npm run build:umd` to only build an unminified UMD module\n  - `npm run build:umd:min` to only build a minified UMD module\n\nNote: all run scripts triggered via `npm run <script>`.\n\nThere are more npm scripts but they are mainly to integrate with CI or are meant to be \"private\" for instance to amend build distribution files with every commit.\n\n## Security Mailing List\n\nWe maintain a mailing list that notifies whenever a security-critical release of DOMPurify was published. This means, if someone found a bypass and we fixed it with a release (which always happens when a bypass was found) a mail will go out to that list. This usually happens within minutes or few hours after learning about a bypass. The list can be subscribed to here:\n\n[https://lists.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/mailman/listinfo/dompurify-security](https://lists.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/mailman/listinfo/dompurify-security)\n\nFeature releases will not be announced to this list.\n\n## Who contributed?\n\nMany people helped and help DOMPurify become what it is and need to be acknowledged here!\n\n[hash_kitten ‚ù§Ô∏è](https://twitter.com/hash_kitten), [kevin_mizu ‚ù§Ô∏è](https://twitter.com/kevin_mizu), [icesfont ‚ù§Ô∏è](https://github.com/icesfont) [dcramer üí∏](https://github.com/dcramer), [JGraph üí∏](https://github.com/jgraph), [baekilda üí∏](https://github.com/baekilda), [Healthchecks üí∏](https://github.com/healthchecks), [Sentry üí∏](https://github.com/getsentry), [jarrodldavis üí∏](https://github.com/jarrodldavis), [CynegeticIO](https://github.com/CynegeticIO), [ssi02014 ‚ù§Ô∏è](https://github.com/ssi02014), [GrantGryczan](https://github.com/GrantGryczan), [Lowdefy](https://twitter.com/lowdefy), [granlem](https://twitter.com/MaximeVeit), [oreoshake](https://github.com/oreoshake), [tdeekens ‚ù§Ô∏è](https://github.com/tdeekens), [peernohell ‚ù§Ô∏è](https://github.com/peernohell), [is2ei](https://github.com/is2ei), [SoheilKhodayari](https://github.com/SoheilKhodayari), [franktopel](https://github.com/franktopel), [NateScarlet](https://github.com/NateScarlet), [neilj](https://github.com/neilj), [fhemberger](https://github.com/fhemberger), [Joris-van-der-Wel](https://github.com/Joris-van-der-Wel), [ydaniv](https://github.com/ydaniv), [terjanq](https://twitter.com/terjanq), [filedescriptor](https://github.com/filedescriptor), [ConradIrwin](https://github.com/ConradIrwin), [gibson042](https://github.com/gibson042), [choumx](https://github.com/choumx), [0xSobky](https://github.com/0xSobky), [styfle](https://github.com/styfle), [koto](https://github.com/koto), [tlau88](https://github.com/tlau88), [strugee](https://github.com/strugee), [oparoz](https://github.com/oparoz), [mathiasbynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens), [edg2s](https://github.com/edg2s), [dnkolegov](https://github.com/dnkolegov), [dhardtke](https://github.com/dhardtke), [wirehead](https://github.com/wirehead), [thorn0](https://github.com/thorn0), [styu](https://github.com/styu), [mozfreddyb](https://github.com/mozfreddyb), [mikesamuel](https://github.com/mikesamuel), [jorangreef](https://github.com/jorangreef), [jimmyhchan](https://github.com/jimmyhchan), [jameydeorio](https://github.com/jameydeorio), [jameskraus](https://github.com/jameskraus), [hyderali](https://github.com/hyderali), [hansottowirtz](https://github.com/hansottowirtz), [hackvertor](https://github.com/hackvertor), [freddyb](https://github.com/freddyb), [flavorjones](https://github.com/flavorjones), [djfarrelly](https://github.com/djfarrelly), [devd](https://github.com/devd), [camerondunford](https://github.com/camerondunford), [buu700](https://github.com/buu700), [buildog](https://github.com/buildog), [alabiaga](https://github.com/alabiaga), [Vector919](https://github.com/Vector919), [Robbert](https://github.com/Robbert), [GreLI](https://github.com/GreLI), [FuzzySockets](https://github.com/FuzzySockets), [ArtemBernatskyy](https://github.com/ArtemBernatskyy), [@garethheyes](https://twitter.com/garethheyes), [@shafigullin](https://twitter.com/shafigullin), [@mmrupp](https://twitter.com/mmrupp), [@irsdl](https://twitter.com/irsdl),[ShikariSenpai](https://github.com/ShikariSenpai), [ansjdnakjdnajkd](https://github.com/ansjdnakjdnajkd), [@asutherland](https://twitter.com/asutherland), [@mathias](https://twitter.com/mathias), [@cgvwzq](https://twitter.com/cgvwzq), [@robbertatwork](https://twitter.com/robbertatwork), [@giutro](https://twitter.com/giutro), [@CmdEngineer\\_](https://twitter.com/CmdEngineer_), [@avr4mit](https://twitter.com/avr4mit) and especially [@securitymb ‚ù§Ô∏è](https://twitter.com/securitymb) & [@masatokinugawa ‚ù§Ô∏è](https://twitter.com/masatokinugawa)\n\n## Testing powered by\n\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.browserstack.com/\"><img width=\"200\" src=\"https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/assets/6709482/f70be7eb-8fc4-41ea-9653-9d359235328f\"></a><br>\n\nAnd last but not least, thanks to [BrowserStack Open-Source Program](https://www.browserstack.com/open-source) for supporting this project with their services for free and delivering excellent, dedicated and very professional support on top of that.\n",

When you doubt for usage of py7zr library with unclear\nmanuals, please feel easy to raise question on forum.\n\nCompression algorithms\n======================\n\n``py7zr`` supports algorithms and filters which `lzma module`_ and `liblzma`_ support,\nand supports BZip2 and Deflate that are implemented in python core libraries,\nIt also supports ZStandard, Brotli and PPMd with third party libraries.\n\n``py7zr`` is also able to encrypt and decrypt data using 3rd party encryption library.\n\n\nSupported algorithms\n--------------------\n\n* compress\n    * LZMA2\n    * LZMA\n    * Bzip2\n    * Deflate\n    * Copy\n    * ZStandard\n    * Brotli\n    * PPMd\n    * Enhanced Deflate (Experimental)\n\n* crypt\n    * 7zAES\n\n* Filters\n    * Delta\n    * BCJ(X86,ARMT,ARM,PPC,SPARC,IA64)\n\n.. note::\n  * A feature handling symbolic link is basically compatible with ``p7zip`` implementation,\n    but not work with original 7-zip because the original does not implement the feature.\n  * ``py7zr`` try checking symbolic links strictly and raise ValueError when bad link is requested,\n    but it does **not** guarantee to block all the bad cases.\n  * ZStandard and Brotli is not default methods of 7-zip, so these archives are considered\n    not to be compatible with original 7-zip on windows/p7zip on linux/mac.\n  * Enhanced Deflate is also known as ``DEFLATE64`` :sup:`TM` that is a registered trademark of ``PKWARE, Inc.``\n  * Enhanced Deflate is tested only on CPython. It is disabled on PyPy.\n\nNot supported algorithms\n------------------------\n\n* BCJ2 (Standard `lzma module`_ does not provide).\n\n\nInstall\n=======\n\nYou can install py7zr as usual other libraries using pip.\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    $ pip install py7zr\n\nOR, alternatively using conda:\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    $ conda install -c conda-forge py7zr\n\nDocuments\n=========\n\nUser manuals\n------------\n\n* `User Guide`_ for latest version.\n\n* `API Guide`_ for latest version.\n\n* `Manual`_ for stable version.\n\nDeveloper guide\n---------------\n\n* `Contribution guidelines`_ for this project.\n\n* `Contribution guidelines(html)`_  for this project.\n\n* `Code of conduct`_ for this project.\n\n* `Code of conduct(html)`_ for this project.\n\n* `7z file specification`_ that py7zr stand on.\n\n\n.. _`User Guide`: https://py7zr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide.html\n\n.. _`API Guide` : https://py7zr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html\n\n.. _`Manual` : https://py7zr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\n\n.. _`Contribution guidelines(html)` : https://py7zr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribution.html\n\n.. _`Contribution guidelines` : docs/contribution.rst\n\n.. _`Code  of conduct` : docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.rst\n\n.. _`Code  of conduct(html)` : https://py7zr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.html\n\n.. _`7z file specification` : https://py7zr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/archive_format.html\n\n\nCLI Usage\n=========\n\nYou can run command script py7zr like as follows;\n\n* List archive contents\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    $ py7zr l test.7z\n\n* Extract archive\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    $ py7zr x test.7z\n\n* Extract archive with password\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    $ py7zr x -P test.7z\n      password?: ****\n\n* Create and compress to archive\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    $ py7zr c target.7z test_dir\n\n* Create multi-volume archive\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    $ py7zr c -v 500k target.7z test_dir\n\n* Test archive\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    $ py7zr t test.7z\n\n* Append files to archive\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    $ py7zr a test.7z test_dir\n\n* Show information\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    $ py7zr i\n\n* Show version\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    $ py7zr --version\n\n\nSevenZipFile Class Usage\n========================\n\npy7zr is a library which can use in your python application.\n\nDecompression/Decryption\n------------------------\n\nHere is a code snippet how to decompress some file in your application.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import py7zr\n\n    archive = py7zr.SevenZipFile('sample.7z', mode='r')\n    archive.extractall(path=\"/tmp\")\n    archive.close()\n\n\n\nYou can also use 'with' block because py7zr provide context manager(v0.6 and later).\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import py7zr\n\n    with py7zr.SevenZipFile('sample.7z', mode='r') as z:\n        z.extractall()\n\n    with py7zr.SevenZipFile('target.7z', 'w') as z:\n        z.writeall('./base_dir')\n\n\n``py7zr`` also supports extraction of single or selected files by 'extract(targets=['file path'])'.\nNote: if you specify only a file but not a parent directory, it will fail.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import py7zr\n    import re\n\n    filter_pattern = re.compile(r'<your/target/file_and_directories/regex/expression>')\n    with py7zr.SevenZipFile('archive.7z', 'r') as archive:\n        allfiles = archive.getnames()\n        selective_files = [f for f in allfiles if filter_pattern.match(f)]\n        archive.extract(targets=selective_files)\n\n\npy7zr support an extraction of password protected archive.(v0.6 and later)\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import py7zr\n\n    with py7zr.SevenZipFile('encrypted.7z', mode='r', password='secret') as z:\n        z.extractall()\n\nCompression/Encryption\n----------------------\n\nHere is a code snippet how to produce archive.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import py7zr\n\n    with py7zr.SevenZipFile('target.7z', 'w') as archive:\n        archive.writeall('/path/to/base_dir', 'base')\n\n\nTo create encrypted archive, please pass a password.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import py7zr\n\n    with py7zr.SevenZipFile('target.7z', 'w', password='secret') as archive:\n        archive.writeall('/path/to/base_dir', 'base')\n\n\nTo create archive with algorithms such as zstandard, you can call with custom filter.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import py7zr\n\n    my_filters = [{\"id\": py7zr.FILTER_ZSTD}]\n    another_filters = [{\"id\": py7zr.FILTER_ARM}, {\"id\": py7zr.FILTER_LZMA2, \"preset\": 7}]\n    with py7zr.SevenZipFile('target.7z', 'w', filters=my_filters) as archive:\n        archive.writeall('/path/to/base_dir', 'base')\n\n\nshutil helper\n=============\n\npy7zr also support `shutil`  interface.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from py7zr import pack_7zarchive, unpack_7zarchive\n    import shutil\n\n    #

Please describe.**\r\nCan't defend against a special path traversal attack\r\nwhen filename like `tmp/../../../../../etc/test.txt`\r\n`py7zr.extractall()` will release the file to the parent directory\r\n\r\nI think the reason is this code https://github.com/miurahr/py7zr/blob/master/py7zr/py7zr.py#L535-L539\r\n```python\r\n        for f in self.files:\r\n            # TODO: sanity check\r\n            # check whether f.filename with invalid characters: '../'\r\n            if f.filename.startswith(\"../\"):\r\n                raise Bad7zFile\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt only handles the case where the filename starts with `../../`\r\nbut if filename is `/tmp/../../../../`, it still case a path traversal attack\r\n\r\nyou can get malicious 7z file from https://github.com/jwilk/traversal-archives \r\n**Non-leading dot-dot** part\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nadd more logic about check filename. like below\r\n```python\r\ndef compress_file_name_check(dir_path, file_name):\r\n    file_name = file_name.lstrip(\"./\")\r\n    full_path = os.path.join(dir_path, file_name)\r\n    if os.path.commonprefix((os.path.realpath(full_path), dir_path)) != dir_path:\r\n        return None\r\n    else:\r\n        return file_name\r\n```\r\nThere is a more detailed discussion thread here, \r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/45188708/how-to-prevent-directory-traversal-attack-from-python-code\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/6803505/does-my-code-prevent-directory-traversal\r\n",

To this\nend, we aim to provide a stack of declarative languages with R-like syntax for (1) the different tasks of the data-science\nlifecycle, and (2) users with different expertise. These high-level scripts are compiled into hybrid execution plans of\nlocal, in-memory CPU and GPU operations, as well as distributed operations on Apache Spark. In contrast to existing\nsystems - that either provide homogeneous tensors or 2D Datasets - and in order to serve the entire data science lifecycle,\nthe underlying data model are DataTensors, i.e., tensors (multi-dimensional arrays) whose first dimension may have a\nheterogeneous and nested schema.\n\n\nResource | Links\n---------|------\n**Quick Start** | [Install, Quick Start and Hello World](https://apache.github.io/systemds/site/install.html)\n**Documentation:** | [SystemDS Documentation](https://apache.github.io/systemds/)\n**Python Documentation** | [Python SystemDS Documentation](https://apache.github.io/systemds/api/python/index.html)\n**Issue Tracker** | [Jira Dashboard](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=12335852)\n\n\n**Status and Build:** SystemDS is renamed from SystemML which is an **Apache Top Level Project**.\nTo build from source visit [SystemDS Install from source](https://apache.github.io/systemds/site/install.html)\n\n[![Build](https://github.com/apache/systemds/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/apache/systemds/actions/workflows/build.yml)\n[![Documentation](https://github.com/apache/systemds/actions/workflows/documentation.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/apache/systemds/actions/workflows/documentation.yml)\n[![LicenseCheck](https://github.com/apache/systemds/actions/workflows/license.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/apache/systemds/actions/workflows/license.yml)\n[![Java Tests](https://github.com/apache/systemds/actions/workflows/javaTests.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/apache/systemds/actions/workflows/javaTests.yml)\n[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/systemds/graph/badge.svg?token=4YfvX8s6Dz)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/systemds)\n[![Python Test](https://github.com/apache/systemds/actions/workflows/python.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/apache/systemds/actions/workflows/python.yml)\n[![Total PyPI downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/personalized-badge/systemds?units=abbreviation&period=total&left_color=grey&right_color=blue&left_text=Total%20PyPI%20Downloads)](https://pepy.tech/project/systemds)\n[![Monthly PyPI downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/personalized-badge/systemds?units=abbreviation&left_color=grey&right_color=blue&left_text=Monthly%20PyPI%20Downloads)](https://pepy.tech/project/systemds)\n",

DIRAC builds a layer between the users and the resources offering a common interface to a number of heterogeneous providers, integrating them in a seamless manner, providing interoperability, at the same time as an optimized, transparent and reliable usage of the resources.\n\nDIRAC has been started by the `LHCb collaboration <https://lhcb.web.cern.ch/lhcb/>`_ who still maintains it. It is now used by several communities (AKA VO=Virtual Organizations) for their distributed computing workflows.\n\nDIRAC is written in python 3.9.\n\nStatus rel-v8r0 series (stable, recommended):\n\n.. image:: https://github.com/DIRACGrid/DIRAC/workflows/Basic%20tests/badge.svg?branch=rel-v8r0\n   :target: https://github.com/DIRACGrid/DIRAC/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Basic+tests%22+branch%3Arel-v8r0\n   :alt: Basic Tests Status\n\n.. image:: https://github.com/DIRACGrid/DIRAC/workflows/pilot%20wrapper/badge.svg?branch=rel-v8r0\n   :target: https://github.com/DIRACGrid/DIRAC/actions?query=workflow%3A%22pilot+wrapper%22+branch%3Arel-v8r0\n   :alt: Pilot Wrapper Status\n\n.. image:: https://github.com/DIRACGrid/DIRAC/workflows/Integration%20tests/badge.svg?branch=rel-v8r0\n   :target: https://github.com/DIRACGrid/DIRAC/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Integration+tests%22+branch%3Arel-v8r0\n   :alt: Integration Tests Status\n\n.. image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/dirac/badge/?version=rel-v8r0\n   :target: http://dirac.readthedocs.io/en/rel-v8r0/\n   :alt: Documentation Status\n\n\nStatus integration branch (devel):\n\n.. image:: https://github.com/DIRACGrid/DIRAC/workflows/Basic%20tests/badge.svg?branch=integration\n   :target: https://github.com/DIRACGrid/DIRAC/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Basic+tests%22+branch%3Aintegration\n   :alt: Basic Tests Status\n\n.. image:: https://github.com/DIRACGrid/DIRAC/workflows/pilot%20wrapper/badge.svg?branch=integration\n   :target: https://github.com/DIRACGrid/DIRAC/actions?query=workflow%3A%22pilot+wrapper%22+branch%3Aintegration\n   :alt: Pilot Wrapper Status\n\n.. image:: https://github.com/DIRACGrid/DIRAC/workflows/Integration%20tests/badge.svg?branch=integration\n   :target: https://github.com/DIRACGrid/DIRAC/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Integration+tests%22+branch%3Aintegration\n   :alt: Integration Tests Status\n\n.. image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/dirac/badge/?version=integration\n   :target: http://dirac.readthedocs.io/en/integration/\n   :alt: Documentation Status\n\nImportant links\n===============\n\n- Official source code repo: https://github.com/DIRACGrid/DIRAC\n- HTML documentation (stable release): http://diracgrid.org (http://dirac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)\n- Issue tracker: https://github.com/DIRACGrid/DIRAC/issues\n- Discussions: https://github.com/DIRACGrid/DIRAC/discussions\n- [ARCHIVED] Support Mailing list: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/diracgrid-forum\n\nInstall\n=======\n\nThere are basically 2 types of installations: client, and server.\n\nFor DIRAC client installation instructions, see the `web page <http://dirac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/UserGuide/GettingStarted/InstallingClient/index.html>`__.\n\nFor DIRAC server installation instructions, see the `web page <https://dirac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/AdministratorGuide/ServerInstallations/InstallingDiracServer.html>`__.\n\nDIRAC 8.0 drops support for Python 2 based clients and servers.\n\nThere are three available options for installation:\n\n.. _conda: https://conda.io/en/latest/index.html\n.. |conda| replace:: **Conda**\n.. _mamba: https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba#the-fast-cross-platform-package-manager\n.. |mamba| replace:: **Mamba**\n.. _condaforge: https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba#the-fast-cross-platform-package-manager\n.. |condaforge| replace:: **conda-forge**\n\n1. **DIRACOS2:** This is the only fully supported method, see the `DIRACOS 2 documentation <https://github.com/DIRACGrid/DIRACOS2/#installing-diracos2>`__.\n2. |conda|_ **/** |mamba|_ **from** |condaforge|_ **:**\n   We recommend making a new environment for DIRAC using\n\n   .. code-block:: bash\n\n     mamba create --name my-dirac-env -c conda-forge dirac-grid\n     conda activate my-dirac-env\n\n3. **Pip:** Provided suitable dependencies are available DIRAC can be installed with ``pip install DIRAC``. Support for installing the dependencies should be sought from the upstream projects.\n\nDevelopment\n===========\n\nFor the full development guide see `here <https://dirac.readthedocs.io/en/integration/DeveloperGuide/DevelopmentEnvironment/index.html>`__, some of the most important details are included below.\n\nContributing\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nDIRAC is a fully open source project, and you are welcome to contribute to it. A list of its main authors can be found `here <AUTHORS.rst>`__ A detailed explanation on how to contribute to DIRAC can be found in `this page <http://dirac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/DeveloperGuide/index.html>`_. For a quick'n dirty guide on how to contribute, simply:\n\n- `Fork the project <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo>`_ inside the GitHub UI\n- Clone locally and create a branch for each change\n\n   .. code-block:: bash\n\n      git clone git@github.com:$GITHUB_USERNAME/DIRAC.git\n      cd DIRAC\n      git remote add upstream git@github.com:DIRACGrid/DIRAC.git\n      git fetch --all\n      git checkout upstream/integration\n      git checkout -b my-feature-branch\n      git push -u origin my-feature-branch\n\n- `Create a Pull Request <https://docs.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests>`_, targeting the \"integration\" branch.\n\nCode quality\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nTo ensure the code meets DIRAC's coding conventions we recommend installing ``pre-commit`` system wide using your operating system's package manager.\nAlteratively, ``pre-commit`` is included in the Python 3 development environment, see the `development guide <https://dirac.readthedocs.io/en/integration/DeveloperGuide/DevelopmentEnvironment/DeveloperInstallation/editingCode.html>`_ for details on how to create one.\n\nOnce ``pre-commit`` is installed you can enable it by running:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n   pre-commit install --allow-missing-config\n\nCode formatting will now be automatically applied before each commit.\n\nTesting\n~~~~~~~\n\nUnit tests are provided within the source code and can be ran using ``pytest``.\nIntegration, regression and system tests are instead in the ``DIRAC/tests/`` directory.\n\nAcknowledgements\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis work is co-funded by the EOSC-hub project (Horizon 2020) under Grant number 777536\n\n|eu-logo| |eosc-hub-web|\n\n.. |eu-logo| image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DIRACGrid/DIRAC/integration/docs/source/_static/eu-logo.jpeg\n\n.. |eosc-hub-web| image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DIRACGrid/DIRAC/integration/docs/source/_static/eosc-hub-web.png\n",
