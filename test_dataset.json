[See this instructions how to install it](#installation-bundled-executable))\n\nThat's it.\n\n### Python Package Index (PyPI) <a id=\"installation-pypi\"></a>\n\nInstalling mangadex-downloader is easy, as long as you have requirements above.\n\n```shell\n# For Windows\npy -3 -m pip install mangadex-downloader\n\n# For Linux / Mac OS\npython3 -m pip install mangadex-downloader\n```\n\nYou can also install optional dependencies\n\n- [py7zr](https://pypi.org/project/py7zr/) for cb7 support\n- [orjson](https://pypi.org/project/orjson/) for maximum performance (fast JSON library)\n- [lxml](https://pypi.org/project/lxml/) for EPUB support\n\nOr you can install all optional dependencies\n\n```shell\n# For Windows\npy -3 -m pip install mangadex-downloader[optional]\n\n# For Mac OS / Linux\npython3 -m pip install mangadex-downloader[optional]\n```\n\nThere you go, easy ain't it ?.\n\n### Bundled executable <a id=\"installation-bundled-executable\"></a>\n\n**NOTE:** This installation only apply to Windows.\n\nBecause this is bundled executable, Python are not required to install.\n\nSteps:\n\n- Download latest version here -> https://github.com/mansuf/mangadex-downloader/releases\n- Extract it.\n- That's it ! You have successfully install mangadex-downloader. \n[See this instructions to run mangadex-downloader](#usage-bundled-executable-version)\n\n### Docker <a id=\"installation-docker\"></a>\n\nAvailable at:\n- https://hub.docker.com/r/mansuf/mangadex-downloader\n- https://gallery.ecr.aws/mansuf/mangadex-downloader\n\n```sh\n# Dockerhub\ndocker pull mansuf/mangadex-downloader\n\n# AWS ECR (Alternative)\ndocker pull public.ecr.aws/mansuf/mangadex-downloader\n```\n\nIf you want to get optional features such as `EPUB` support, `cb7` support, etc.\nYou can use tag ending with `-optional`\n\n```sh\n# Dockerhub\ndocker pull mansuf/mangadex-downloader:latest-optional\ndocker pull mansuf/mangadex-downloader:v2.10.3-optional\n\n# AWS ECR (Alternative)\ndocker pull public.ecr.aws/mansuf/mangadex-downloader:latest-optional\ndocker pull public.ecr.aws/mansuf/mangadex-downloader:v2.10.3-optional\n```\n\n**NOTE**: If you're wondering why optional tags doesn't have arm/v6 platform support. \nThat's because some dependencies (most notably `orjson`) require rust compiler \nand i give up installing rust compiler in arm/v6 platform, there is too much errors for me. \n\n### Development version <a id=\"installation-development-version\"></a>\n\n**NOTE:** You must have git installed.

We will do our best to respond to your report within \n7 days and also to keep you informed of the progress of our efforts to resolve the issue, \nbut understand that ESPHome, like many open source projects, is relying heavily on \nvolunteers that aren’t full-time resources. We may not be able to respond as quickly as you \nwould like due to other responsibilities.\n\n## SUPPORTED VERSIONS\n\nWe only accept reports against the latest stable & official versions of ESPHome or any versions \nbeyond that are currently in development or beta test. \nThe latest version can be found on our [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/releases).\n\nWe do not accept reports against forks of ESPHome.\n\n## PUBLIC DISCLOSURE & CVE ASSIGNMENT\n\nWe will publish GitHub Security Advisories and through those, will also request CVEs, \nfor valid vulnerabilities that meet the following criteria:\n\n- The vulnerability is in ESPHome itself, not any third-party library or external component.\n- The vulnerability is not already known to us.\n- The vulnerability is not already known to the public.\n- CVEs will only be requested for vulnerabilities with a severity of medium or higher.\n\n## BOUNTIES\nAs an open source project, ESPHome cannot offer bounties for security vulnerabilities. \nHowever, if so desired, we of course will credit the discoverer of a vulnerability.\n",

Couldn't this be used to also downgrade to WEP, and then break that? I will have to look at how WEP attacks work (if it's during handshake phase or later)\r\n - [ ] Test the mitigation actually works (not sure if I'll be able to do that, I don't have the hardware around to create wifi packets in promiscuous mode)\r\n\r\n**Related issue (if applicable):** fixes <link to issue>\r\n\r\n**Pull request in [esphome-docs](https://github.com/esphome/esphome-docs) with documentation (if applicable):** esphome/esphome-docs#<esphome-docs PR number goes here>\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n  - [x] The code change is tested and works locally.\r\n  - [ ] Tests have been added to verify that the new code works (under `tests/` folder).\r\n\r\nIf user exposed functionality or configuration variables are added/changed:\r\n  - [ ] Documentation added/updated in [esphome-docs](https://github.com/esphome/esphome-docs).\r\n",

ESP scans for new networks again\r\n - When connecting to \"Open Network\", I see the message `Potential Authmode downgrade detected, disconnecting..`, even though it's not this attack, and disconnects. The second time it tries to connect it works though.\r\n\r\nThis is because the code doesn't know if it was previously connected or not. I won't fix that at this time because it's a minor annoyance that few people will experience (having multiple networks with different auth mode is unlikely).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAlso, something's up with GH actions today, the `CI / test (test 1)` job is running on the \"Fix Typo\" commit, not the latest one.",

We plan to do more than simply replicate the functionalities of the legacy TAK server, our road map includes integration with open source systems like LORA's Meshtastic, porting it to Android, having an open API, and much more.\n\nWe are doing it for free because we believe that donating personal time to a cause is an endeavour that is worthy per-se, However, we are also spending our own time and money to:\n\n- Maintain a Public server and a test server\n- Invest in different technologies for R&D\n\nIf you feel that FTS is useful to you and you can donate in those challenging times please consider contributing here:\n[DONATE](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=brothercorvo%40gmail.com&item_name=FreeTAKServer+R%26D&currency_code=CAD&source=url)\n\nYou can also support the project by buying one of our [t-shirts](http://tee.pub/lic/elARpZYCmaw).\n\n**_NOTE_**:\n\n> Not a big fan of Paypal, but that is the easiest way I found for an initial attempt. We may go to some more ethical system in future.\n> Finally you can help the project by spamming FTS information, starring our repositories in github and Pip and upvoting us.\n\n[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=FreeTAKTeam/FreeTakServer,tkuester/taky,TAK-Product-Center/Server&type=Date)](https://star-history.com/#FreeTAKTeam/FreeTakServer&tkuester/taky&TAK-Product-Center/Server&Date)\n\n## Open Source Notes\n\nFTS was made possible by the following Open Source projects.\nWe'd like to thank the following individuals and organizations for providing crucial support and making FTS possible.\n\n- [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/)\n- [lxml](https://lxml.de/)\n- [pathlib](https://pathlib.readthedocs.io/en/pep428/)\n- [tabulate](https://pypi.org/project/tabulate/)\n- [sqlalchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)\n- [setuptools](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/)\n- [eventlet](https://eventlet.net/)\n- [random_word](https://pypi.org/project/Random-Word/)\n- [Pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)\n- [Bootstrap4](https://getbootstrap.com/)\n- [pyopenssl](https://pypi.org/project/pyOpenSSL/)\n- [Flask Dashboard Black by AppSeed](https://github.com/app-generator/flask-black-dashboard)\n",

(no MISP connection needed)\n\nThis user guide should help you through the [installation](#installation) of **MISP-Maltego**, and should guide you how to use it through a few [use-cases](#use-cases). As this is a collaborative project, do not hesitate to propose changes, write other use-cases or raise [feature requests](https://github.com/MISP/MISP-maltego/issues) for missing features.\n\n## Quick start\nCurrently supported MISP elements are : Event, Attribute, Object (incl relations), Tag, Taxonomy, Galaxy (incl relations).\n\nOnce installed you can start by creating a `MISPEvent` entity, then load the Machine `EventToAll` or the transform `EventToAttributes`.\n\nAlternatively initiate a transform on an existing Maltego entity.\nThe currently supported entities are: `AS`, `DNSName`, `Domain`, `EmailAddress`, `File`, `Hash`, `IPv4Address`, `NSRecord`, `Person`, `PhoneNumber`, `URL`, `Website`\n\nFor MITRE ATT&CK pivoting, feel free to start with an `Attack Technique`, `Software`, `Threat Actor`, or `MISPGalaxy`. Create your entity, enter a keyword such as `%gama%` and use the `Search in MISP` transform to get started. \n\n## Installation\n### Transform Hub\nOpen the Transform Hub, locate **ATT&CK - MISP** and press the **Install** button. \n\nYour transforms will go through Paterva's servers and ours. See the [Transform Hub Disclaimer](https://github.com/MISP/MISP-maltego/blob/master/TRANSFORM_HUB_DISCLAIMER.md) for more information.\n\n- ATT&CK transforms do not require a MISP server or API key to be configured.\n- MISP transforms requires your MISP server to be reachable from the internet! To enter your MISP server URL and key click **Details** on the Transform Hub item and then **Settings** at the bottom right. \n\n### Local Transform Installation\nIf you trust nobody, or just want to connect to your local MISP server you can install everything as local transforms.\n\nThese instructions have been tested on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, but should be similar on other systems.\n1. Download and install [Maltego](https://www.paterva.com/web7/downloads.php)\n2. Install using pip: `sudo pip3 install MISP-maltego`\n3. Generate the Maltego bundle: `canari create-profile MISP_maltego`\n4. Import this bundle in Maltego. \n   1. Open Maltego\n   2. Click on the home button (Maltego icon, top-left corner).\n   3. Click on 'Import'\n   4. Click on 'Import Configuration'.\n   5. Load the `MISP_maltego.mtz` file and follow the prompts.\n5. Edit `$HOME/.canari/MISP_maltego.conf` and enter your `misp_url` and `misp_key`\n\n## Custom Entities\nMISP-Maltego tries to use as much as possible the default Paterva entities, or the most popular from the community. It however comes with a few custom entities: \n* **MISPEvent**: A representation of an *Event* on MISP, containing *Attributes* (MISP) / *Entities* (Maltego)\n* **MISPObject**: A way to group associated attributes in a structured way.\n* **MISPGalaxy**: A *Tag* containing much more metadata. Please refer to the [MISP Galaxy](https://github.com/MISP/misp-galaxy) for more information. **MITRE ATT&CK** is for example completely available through MISPGalaxy entities (see use-cases for an example)\n* **Attack Technique**: Attack patterns or techniques, see [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/enterprise/) for more information.\n* **Threat Actor**: Threat actor or intrusion sets.\n* **Software**: Software is a generic term for custom or commercial code, operating system utilities, open-source software, or other tools used to conduct behavior modeled in ATT&CK. \n\n# Use Cases\n## Transform on existing data\nIn this use case we will be using already existing entities and will initiate a transform using MISP. The currently supported entities are: `AS`, `DNSName`, `Domain`, `EmailAddress`, `File`, `Hash`, `IPv4Address`, `NSRecord`, `Person`, `PhoneNumber`, `URL`, `Website`.\n\nExample:\n* create an entity `domain` with the value `1dnscontrol.com`.\n* right click and choose *Local Transforms*  > *MISP_maltego* > *Domain To Event*  \n![animated screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MISP/MISP-maltego/master/doc/img/usecase1-transform.gif)\n* continue loading transforms on the *MISP Event*\n\n## Transform from MISP Event ID\nWhile MISP already has a graphing capability we would like to use the power of Maltego to look at the data and expand the work.\n* Create a *MISP Event* and give it an `event id`, or `UUID`\n* One **manual** way is to right click and choose *Local Transforms* > *MISP_maltego* > *Event To Attributes* \n  * Notice the event is transformed to *Attributes*, *Objects*, *Tags*, *Galaxies* and related *MISP Events*\n  * You can now further transform on an *Object* > *Object To Attributes* and see the content of the object\n![machine transforms](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MISP/MISP-maltego/master/doc/img/usecase2-manual.gif)\n* Alternatively you can also use the **Maltego Machine** to speed up things. \n   * Click on the *MISP Event* and in the left menu choose *Event to All* in the *Machines* section. \n![machine transforms](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MISP/MISP-maltego/master/doc/img/usecase2-machine-menu.png)\n   * Notice that the whole event, objects and such will get expanded with data from your MISP instance.\n![animated screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MISP/MISP-maltego/master/doc/img/usecase2-machine.gif)\n* You can now further transform on any data.\n\n## Which data is already in MISP?\nIf you use MISP as central database it can be quite convenient to know which data is present in MISP, and which data is not; especially after using a number of other transforms.\nTo permit this MISP-Maltego will always add a green bookmark to all the data that is present in MISP.\n![green bookmark](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MISP/MISP-maltego/master/doc/img/usecase3-bookmark.png)\n\n\n## Searching in MISP using keywords\nAs with the MISP attribute search through the MISP Web UI you can use `%` wildcards at the front and end to specify the substring. You might be tempted to always use `%keyword%`, but bare in mind how databases indexes work; a search for `keyword%` will always be much faster than `%keyword`.\n![Search in MISP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MISP/MISP-maltego/master/doc/img/search_in_misp.gif)\n\n\n## Transform from Galaxy\nGalaxies are actually tags with much more contextual data. Examples are threat actors, malware families, but also the whole MITRE ATT&CK data is available as Galaxy. All this data comes from the [MISP Galaxy](https://github.com/MISP/misp-galaxy) repository. Today the integration is not done using a MISP server because of limitations in MISP.\nYou might encounter Galaxies when transforming from MISP Events or Attributes. An alternative use-case is by starting immediately from a Galaxy.\nThere are 3 ways to manually create a good Galaxy Entity.\n1. Using a find capability (see below)\n2. Create the Galaxy and set the UUID. You can find the UUIDs in the [MISP Galaxy](https://github.com/MISP/misp-galaxy) repository.\n3. Create the Galaxy with the right tag name; for example: `misp-galaxy:`\n\nTo use the magical search feature:\n* Create a *MISP Galaxy* and type the keyword as value.\n* Run the *Galaxy To Relation* transform, notice the search results will appear as connected entities\n* Remove the non-relevant entities, including the your search-keyword\n![animated galaxy search](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MISP/MISP-maltego/master/doc/img/usecase4-galaxy-search.gif)\n\n## Visualize MITRE ATT&CK\nApply the same steps for MITRE ATT&CK browsing:\n\n![animated ATTACK](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MISP/MISP-maltego/master/doc/img/usecase5-attack.gif)\n\nYou might end up with such a graph:\n\n![ATTACK](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MISP/MISP-maltego/master/doc/img/usecase5-attack.png)\n\n## Visualise common ATT&CK patterns\nHaving access to a large amount of Threat information through MISP Threat Sharing communities gives you outstanding opportunities to aggregate this information and take the process of trying to understand how all this data fits together telling a broader story to the next level. We are transforming technical data or indicators of compromise (IOCs) into cyber threat intelligence. This is where the analytical challenge begins. [[read more](https://www.misp-project.org/2019/10/27/visualising_common_patterns_attack.html)]\n\n\n## Massively large MISP event? Think before you transform.\nIn some communities such as the [COVID-19 MISP](https://www.misp-project.org/covid-19-misp/) some events contain tens of thousands attributes. Loading all the attributes from these events might not be a good idea if you do not have Maltego XL.\nYou can see the amount of attributes and objects in the Event properties, so you can think before you click:\n\n![object count](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MISP/MISP-maltego/master/doc/img/event_count_attr1.png)![attribute count](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MISP/MISP-maltego/master/doc/img/event_count_attr2.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## License\nThis software is licensed under [GNU Affero General Public License version 3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html)\n\n* Copyright (C) 2018-2024 Christophe Vandeplas\n\nNote: Before being rewritten from scratch this project was maintained by Emmanuel Bouillon.

Thanks for checking it out.\n\nAll documentation is in the \"``docs``\" directory and online at\nhttps://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/. If you're just getting started,\nhere's how we recommend you read the docs:\n\n* First, read ``docs/intro/install.txt`` for instructions on installing Django.\n\n* Next, work through the tutorials in order (``docs/intro/tutorial01.txt``,\n  ``docs/intro/tutorial02.txt``, etc.).\n\n* If you want to set up an actual deployment server, read\n  ``docs/howto/deployment/index.txt`` for instructions.\n\n* You'll probably want to read through the topical guides (in ``docs/topics``)\n  next; from there you can jump to the HOWTOs (in ``docs/howto``) for specific\n  problems, and check out the reference (``docs/ref``) for gory details.\n\n* See ``docs/README`` for instructions on building an HTML version of the docs.\n\nDocs are updated rigorously. If you find any problems in the docs, or think\nthey should be clarified in any way, please take 30 seconds to fill out a\nticket here: https://code.djangoproject.com/newticket\n\nTo get more help:\n\n* Join the ``#django`` channel on ``irc.libera.chat``. Lots of helpful people\n  hang out there. `Webchat is available <https://web.libera.chat/#django>`_.\n\n* Join the django-users mailing list, or read the archives, at\n  https://groups.google.com/group/django-users.\n\n* Join the `Django Discord community <https://discord.gg/xcRH6mN4fa>`_.\n\n* Join the community on the `Django Forum <https://forum.djangoproject.com/>`_.\n\nTo contribute to Django:\n\n* Check out https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/ for\n  information about getting involved.\n\nTo run Django's test suite:\n\n* Follow the instructions in the \"Unit tests\" section of\n  ``docs/internals/contributing/writing-code/unit-tests.txt``, published online at\n  https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/writing-code/unit-tests/#running-the-unit-tests\n\nSupporting the Development of Django\n====================================\n\nDjango's development depends on your contributions.\n\nIf you depend on Django, remember to support the Django Software Foundation: https://www.djangoproject.com/fundraising/\n",

        "SecurityPolicy_content": "=======================\nSecurity considerations\n=======================\n\nTransmission security\n=====================\n\nUse https for the web interface as well as for the update client (if possible).\n\nOtherwise, your username / password (FQDN / update secret) will be transmitted\nin clear text (unencrypted).\n\nThe web interface will warn you if you use it via http. If WE_HAVE_TLS is\nset to True, it will suggest you better use the https site and link there.\n\nAdditionally, the service administrator can implement a redirect from the\nhttp to the https site within the webserver configuration for the WWW_HOST.\nThe redirect should **not** be implemented for WWW_IPV4_HOST and WWW_IPV6_HOST\nas it is unknown whether all update clients can deal with a redirect (and\nsupport TLS).\n\nFor the router / update client configuration examples we show when creating a\nupdate secret, we use update URLs with https: (and we also tell why it might\nnot work).\n\nOn the hosts overview page, we show whether we received the last update via TLS.\n\nPlease note that if you like security, you also need to use https (with\ncertificate verification) if you use the web-based method to query your IP\naddress. If you use http, a powerful attacker could MITM your request and\ntell you a wrong IP, which your updater then would happily write into DNS.\n\n\nLogin with remote vs. local Account\n===================================\n\nIf you use a already existing remote account to log in into our service, you\ndon't need to create a local profile (with username, E-Mail and password).\n\nThat way, we need to store less information about you - especially no password\nhash (and you also don't need to create a new password just for our service).\nSo, this is a little more safe if you just consider our service.\n\nBUT: If you use some external service to log in, you of course need to trust\nthem for this purpose as *they* are telling \"yes, this is really you\".\n\nAlso, if you cancel the account on that external service and you don't have\na local profile (login, E-Mail, password) with us, you will be unable to log\nin afterwards or recover access to your hosts/domains.\n\nSo maybe the best way is to first create a local profile (username, E-Mail,\npassword), then log in and associate your other remote accounts with that\nlocal profile.\n\n\nPasswords / Secrets / Keys\n==========================\n\nInteractive login password\n--------------------------\n\nWe recommend that you use a rather strong and not guessable password for this.\nDo not re-use passwords, use a password system or a password manager.\n\nThe interactive login password for the web site is stored using Django's\ndefault hasher mechanism, which is currently pbkdf2 (a very strong and\nintentionally slow password hash). Brute-Force attacks against such hashes are\nvery slow, much slower than against simple hashes like (s)sha1/sha256 etc.\n\nIt is NOT stored in clear text by nsupdate.info.\n\nIf you lose the password, you'll have to do a password reset via e-mail.\n\n\nAutomated update secret\n-----------------------\n\nThe automated update secret for routers or other update clients is a\nrandom and automatically generated secret. We store it using the sha1 hasher\nof Django (which in fact is salted-sha1, a not very strong, but fast-to-compute\nhash).\n\nConsidering that a lot of routers or update clients store this secret in clear\ntext in their configuration and often transmit it using unencrypted http (and\nnot https), this secret is not too safe anyway. We also wanted to save some cpu\ncycles here and rather not use pbkdf2 for this regularly and automatically used\nsecret.\n\nIt is not stored in clear text by nsupdate.info.\n\nIf you lose the secret, you'll have to generate a new one and change it in your\nupdate client also.\n\nWe use a random and automatically generated update secret to avoid that users\nenter a bad password here (like reusing a password they use somewhere else,\nchoosing a too simple password) and to avoid disclosure of such user-chosen\npasswords in case the hashes ever get stolen and brute forced.\n\n\nNameserver Update Secret (backend, RFC 2136)\n--------------------------------------------\n\nWe currently store this secret (which is basically a base64 encoded shared secret,\none per dynamic zone) \"as is\" into the database (\"Domain\" records there).\n\nThis is somehow critical, but also hard to do better - encryption would only\nhelp very little here as we would need to decrypt the update secret before using it,\nso we would need the unlocked decryption key on the same machine.\n\nMake sure no unauthorized person gets that secret or he/she will be able to update\nANY record in the respective zone / nameserver directly (without going over\nnsupdate.info software / service).\n\nWe support creating a random update secret, so you don't need an extra tool for this.\n\n\nOther Services Update Secret (dyndns2 client)\n---------------------------------------------\n\nWe need to store this secret \"as is\" into the database for the same reasons as\noutlined above.\n\nBut: we tell you in the services overview whether we'll use TLS to transmit the\nupdate, so at least if TLS is enabled, it won't go unencrypted over the wire.\n\n\nCSRF protection\n===============\n\nWe use Django's CSRF protection middleware.\n\n\nClickjacking protection\n=======================\n\nWe use Django's clickjacking protection middleware.\n\n\nXSS protection\n==============\n\nDjango's templating engine html-escapes inputs by default.\n\n\nCookies\n=======\n\nThe software (\"as is\") uses these cookies:\n\n* \"csrftoken\" (host-only, for CSRF protection)\n* \"sessionid\" (host-only, to keep the session when you have logged-in to the\n  web interface)\n\nIf you have set WE_HAVE_TLS to True (because you run the software on a https\nsite), you should also set *_COOKIE_SECURE to True to avoid the cookies getting\ntransmitted via http.\n\nWe use a session cookie by default (gets cleared when you close the browser).\nIf you check the \"Keep me logged in\" checkbox on the login screen, then we'll\nset a permanent cookie with a lifetime as configured by the site admin\n(SESSION_COOKIE_AGE, default: 14 days).\n\nBe careful with domain cookies\n------------------------------\n\nThe software (\"as is\") does not use any domain cookies.\n\nIn case you modify the software, please be extremely cautious with domain\ncookies and in case of doubt, do rather not use them.\n\nIf you use domain cookies (like for \".yourservice.net\", the leading dot\nmakes it a domain cookie), all hosts in that domain would be able to read\nand write these cookies. Your site (at e.g. www.yourservice.net), but also\nusers' sites (like attacker.yourservice.net).\n\nObviously, this might lead to security issues with stealing, modifying and\nfaking domain cookies.\n\n\nDjango's SECRET_KEY\n===================\n\nDjango's SECRET_KEY needs to be a long, random and secret string (it is\nusually set up by the administrator of the site).\n\nThe builtin default settings will try to read SECRET_KEY from an environment\nvariable of same name. If there is no such environment variable, the SECRET_KEY\nwill be undefined.\n\nYou can also define the SECRET_KEY in your local_settings.py.\n\nIf you do not define a SECRET_KEY by one of these methods, the application\nwill refuse to start and give you an error, that a SECRET_KEY is required.\n",

The only critical thing is that your domain provider is willing to add the DS records to the top level domain.\n\nFor my zone I have the following config for DNSSEC with nsupdate:\n\n```\nzone \"stratum0.net\" {\n        auto-dnssec maintain;\n        type master;\n        update-policy {\n                  ....\n        };\n        file \"/etc/bind/stratum0.net/stratum0.net\";\n        key-directory \"/etc/bind/stratum0.net\";\n};\n```\n\nOnly auto-dnssec maintain and key-directory \"/etc/bind/stratum0.net\" are relevant to DNSSEC. With this setup, you only need to use dnssec-keygen to generate the KSK and ZSK. Finally you generate the DS records with dnssec-dsfromkey -f <zonefile> and pass those to your domain provider. There is a short guide at http://fanf.livejournal.com/112476.html.\n\nIf your domain provider doesn't support DNSSEC, you can use [DLV (DNSSEC Look-aside Validation)](https://dlv.isc.org/). It's an alternative entry point and also very useful for initial testing.\n\nAlso very useful for debugging is http://dnsviz.net/d/stratum0.net/dnssec/, which shows you a graph of all keys and their relationships. The gray DNSKEYs are KSKs and the while ones are ZSKs. To keep DNS messages smaller, DNSSEC uses shorter keys and so they must be rotated regularly. The longer (2048 bit) KSKs have a lifetime on the order of years and the shorter (1024 bit) ZSKs on the order of months. Note that they do not expire after this time, it's just strongly recommended to perform a rollover after that time.\n\nWith auto-dnssec maintain, you just have to generate new keys. The metadata in the key files allows BIND to handle the rollover automatically. For KSK changes, you'd need to notify your domain provider again.\n\nThis setup has been running without problems for since two months on stratum0.net (which provides DYNDNS for our hackerspace).\n",

The only critical thing is that your domain provider is willing to add the DS records to the top level domain.\n\nFor my zone I have the following config for DNSSEC with nsupdate:\n\n```\nzone \"stratum0.net\" {\n        auto-dnssec maintain;\n        type master;\n        update-policy {\n                  ....\n        };\n        file \"/etc/bind/stratum0.net/stratum0.net\";\n        key-directory \"/etc/bind/stratum0.net\";\n};\n```\n\nOnly auto-dnssec maintain and key-directory \"/etc/bind/stratum0.net\" are relevant to DNSSEC. With this setup, you only need to use dnssec-keygen to generate the KSK and ZSK. Finally you generate the DS records with dnssec-dsfromkey -f <zonefile> and pass those to your domain provider. There is a short guide at http://fanf.livejournal.com/112476.html.\n\nIf your domain provider doesn't support DNSSEC, you can use [DLV (DNSSEC Look-aside Validation)](https://dlv.isc.org/). It's an alternative entry point and also very useful for initial testing.\n\nAlso very useful for debugging is http://dnsviz.net/d/stratum0.net/dnssec/, which shows you a graph of all keys and their relationships. The gray DNSKEYs are KSKs and the while ones are ZSKs. To keep DNS messages smaller, DNSSEC uses shorter keys and so they must be rotated regularly. The longer (2048 bit) KSKs have a lifetime on the order of years and the shorter (1024 bit) ZSKs on the order of months. Note that they do not expire after this time, it's just strongly recommended to perform a rollover after that time.\n\nWith auto-dnssec maintain, you just have to generate new keys. The metadata in the key files allows BIND to handle the rollover automatically. For KSK changes, you'd need to notify your domain provider again.\n\nThis setup has been running without problems for since two months on stratum0.net (which provides DYNDNS for our hackerspace).\n",

See\nhttps://palletsprojects.com/security, the canonical location for the policy,\nwhich this is copied from.\n\n## Before Reporting\n\nThere are some things we generally do not consider security issues, which can be\nfound at the canonical policy page: https://palletsprojects.com/security. Please\nreview the list before reporting an issue. You may still err on the side of\ncaution and make a private report first, but we may close it or ask you to\nreport a regular issue instead.\n\n## Reporting a Security Issue\n\nIf you believe you have identified a security issue with a Pallets or\nPallets-Eco project, **do not open a public issue**. To responsibly report a\nsecurity issue, use GitHub's [security advisory system][gh-docs]. From the\nproject's repository, click \"Security\" at the top, then click \"Advisories\" at\nthe left, then click the green \"New draft security advisory\" button.\nAlternatively, you may email [security@palletsprojects.com](mailto:security@palletsprojects.com),\nand we will convert that to a GitHub security advisory.\n\nBe sure to include as much detail as necessary in your report. As with reporting\nnormal issues, a minimal reproducible example will help the maintainers address\nthe issue faster. Information about why the issue is a security issue is also\nhelpful. If you are able, you may also provide a fix for the issue.\n\nA maintainer will reply acknowledging the report and how to continue. We will\nobtain a CVE id as well, please do not do this on your own. We will work with\nyou to attempt to understand the issue and decide on its validity. Maintainers\nare volunteers working in their free time, and therefore cannot guarantee any\nspecific timeline. Please be patient during this process.\n\nThe current feature release will receive security fixes. A backport to the\nprevious feature branch may be considered upon request based on usage information\nand severity, but is not guaranteed.\n\n[gh-docs]: https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/creating-a-repository-security-advisory\n",

Your support helps promote the project and lets others know that it's worth checking out. \n\nThank you for your support! 🌟\n\n[![Star this project](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/zenml-io/zenml?style=social)](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/stargazers)\n\n## 🤸 Quickstart\n[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/zenml-io/zenml/blob/main/examples/quickstart/quickstart.ipynb)\n\n[Install ZenML](https://docs.zenml.io/getting-started/installation) via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/zenml/). Python 3.9 - 3.12 is required:\n\n```bash\npip install \"zenml[server]\" notebook\n```\n\nTake a tour with the guided quickstart by running:\n\n```bash\nzenml go\n```\n\n## 🪄 Simple, integrated, End-to-end MLOps \n\n### Create machine learning pipelines with minimal code changes\n\nZenML is a MLOps framework intended for data scientists or ML engineers looking to standardize machine learning practices. Just add `@step` and `@pipeline` to your existing Python functions to get going. Here is a toy example:\n\n```python\nfrom zenml import pipeline, step\n\n@step  # Just add this decorator\ndef load_data() -> dict:\n    training_data = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]\n    labels = [0, 1, 0]\n    return {'features': training_data, 'labels': labels}\n\n@step\ndef train_model(data: dict) -> None:\n    total_features = sum(map(sum, data['features']))\n    total_labels = sum(data['labels'])\n    \n    print(f\"Trained model using {len(data['features'])} data points. \"\n          f\"Feature sum is {total_features}, label sum is {total_labels}\")\n\n@pipeline  # This function combines steps together \ndef simple_ml_pipeline():\n    dataset = load_data()\n    train_model(dataset)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    run = simple_ml_pipeline()  # call this to run the pipeline\n   \n```\n\n![Running a ZenML pipeline](/docs/book/.gitbook/assets/readme_basic_pipeline.gif)\n\n### Easily provision an MLOps stack or reuse your existing infrastructure\n\nThe framework is a gentle entry point for practitioners to build complex ML pipelines with little knowledge required of the underlying infrastructure complexity. ZenML pipelines can be run on AWS, GCP, Azure, Airflow, Kubeflow and even on Kubernetes without having to change any code or know underlying internals. \n\nZenML provides different features to aid people to get started quickly on a remote setting as well. If you want to deploy a remote stack from scratch on your selected cloud provider, you can use the 1-click deployment feature either through the dashboard:\n\n![Running a ZenML pipeline](/docs/book/.gitbook/assets/one-click-deployment.gif)\n\nOr, through our CLI command:\n\n```bash\nzenml stack deploy --provider aws\n```\n\nAlternatively, if the necessary pieces of infrastructure is already deployed, you can register a cloud stack seamlessly through the stack wizard:\n\n```bash\nzenml stack register <STACK_NAME> --provider aws\n```\n\nRead more about [ZenML stacks](https://docs.zenml.io/user-guide/production-guide/understand-stacks).\n\n### Run workloads easily on your production infrastructure\n\nOnce you have your MLOps stack configured, you can easily run workloads on it:\n\n```bash\nzenml stack set <STACK_NAME>\npython run.py\n```\n\n```python\nfrom zenml.config import ResourceSettings, DockerSettings\n\n@step(\n  settings={\n    \"resources\": ResourceSettings(memory=\"16GB\", gpu_count=\"1\", cpu_count=\"8\"),\n    \"docker\": DockerSettings(parent_image=\"pytorch/pytorch:1.12.1-cuda11.3-cudnn8-runtime\")\n  }\n)\ndef training(...):\n\t...\n```\n\n![Workloads with ZenML](/docs/book/.gitbook/assets/readme_compute.gif)\n\n### Track models, pipeline, and artifacts\n\nCreate a complete lineage of who, where, and what data and models are produced.\n\nYou’ll be able to find out who produced which model, at what time, with which data, and on which version of the code. This guarantees full reproducibility and auditability.\n\n```python\nfrom zenml import Model\n\n@step(model=Model(name=\"classification\"))\ndef trainer(training_df: pd.DataFrame) -> Annotated[\"model\", torch.nn.Module]:\n\t...\n```\n\n![Exploring ZenML Models](/docs/book/.gitbook/assets/readme_mcp.gif)\n\n### Purpose built for machine learning with integration to you favorite tools\n\nWhile ZenML brings a lot of value of the box, it also integrates into your existing tooling and infrastructure without you having to be locked in.\n\n```python\nfrom bentoml._internal.bento import bento\n\n@step(on_failure=alert_slack, experiment_tracker=\"mlflow\")\ndef train_and_deploy(training_df: pd.DataFrame) -> bento.Bento\n\tmlflow.autolog()\n\t...\n\treturn bento\n```\n\n![Exploring ZenML Integrations](/docs/book/.gitbook/assets/readme_integrations.gif)\n\n## 🖼️ Learning\n\nThe best way to learn about ZenML is the [docs](https://docs.zenml.io/). We recommend beginning with the [Starter Guide](https://docs.zenml.io/user-guide/starter-guide) to get up and running quickly.\n\nIf you are a visual learner, this 11-minute video tutorial is also a great start:\n\n[![Introductory Youtube Video](docs/book/.gitbook/assets/readme_youtube_thumbnail.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEVwIkDvUPs)\n\nAnd finally, here are some other examples and use cases for inspiration:\n\n1.

[LLMops](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml-projects/tree/main/llm-complete-guide): Complete guide to do LLM with ZenML\n\n\n## 🔋 Deploy ZenML\n\nFor full functionality ZenML should be deployed on the cloud to\nenable collaborative features as the central MLOps interface for teams.\n\nCurrently, there are two main ways to deploy ZenML:\n\n- **ZenML Pro**: [ZenML Pro](cloud.zenml.io/?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=referral_link&utm_campaign=cloud_promotion&utm_content=signup_link),\noffers a SaaS version which comes with a control plane to create and manage multiple ZenML servers.\nThese servers are managed and maintained by ZenML’s dedicated team, alleviating\nthe burden of server management from your end. They also come with additional features like RBAC, a Model Control Plane\nand [much more](https://zenml-io.gitbook.io/zenml-documentation/getting-started/zenml-pro.\n- **Self-hosted deployment**: Alternatively, you have the flexibility to [deploy\nZenML on your own self-hosted environment](https://docs.zenml.io/getting-started/deploying-zenml#deploying-a-zenml-server).\nThis can be achieved through various methods, including using our CLI, Docker,\nHelm, or HuggingFace Spaces.\n\n## Use ZenML with VS Code\n\nZenML has a [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ZenML.zenml-vscode) that allows you to inspect your stacks and pipeline runs directly from your editor. The extension also allows you to switch your stacks without needing to type any CLI commands.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>🖥️ VS Code Extension in Action!</summary>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n  <img width=\"60%\" src=\"/docs/book/.gitbook/assets/zenml-extension-shortened.gif\" alt=\"ZenML Extension\">\n</div>\n</details>\n\n## 🗺 Roadmap\n\nZenML is being built in public. The [roadmap](https://zenml.io/roadmap) is a regularly updated source of truth for the ZenML community to understand where the product is going in the short, medium, and long term.\n\nZenML is managed by a [core team](https://zenml.io/company) of developers that are responsible for making key decisions and incorporating feedback from the community. The team oversees feedback via various channels,\nand you can directly influence the roadmap as follows:\n\n- Vote on your most wanted feature on our [Discussion\nboard](https://zenml.io/discussion).\n- Start a thread in our [Slack channel](https://zenml.io/slack).\n- [Create an issue](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/issues/new/choose) on our GitHub repo.\n\n## 🙌 Contributing and Community\n\nWe would love to develop ZenML together with our community! The best way to get\nstarted is to select any issue from the `[good-first-issue`\nlabel](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+archived%3Afalse+user%3Azenml-io+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)\nand open up a Pull Request! \n\nIf you\nwould like to contribute, please review our [Contributing\nGuide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for all relevant details.\n\n## 🆘 Getting Help\n\nThe first point of call should\nbe [our Slack group](https://zenml.io/slack-invite/).\nAsk your questions about bugs or specific use cases, and someone from\nthe [core team](https://zenml.io/company) will respond.\nOr, if you\nprefer, [open an issue](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/issues/new/choose) on\nour GitHub repo.\n\n## ⭐️ Show Your Support\n\nIf you find ZenML helpful or interesting, please consider giving us a star on GitHub.

A dashboard update is required to pass the current password to the call made to the API (handled with https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml-dashboard/pull/556)\r\n\r\n## Pre-requisites\r\nPlease ensure you have done the following:\r\n- [x] I have read the **CONTRIBUTING.md** document.\r\n- [ ] If my change requires a change to docs, I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n- [ ] I have added tests to cover my changes.\r\n- [x] I have based my new branch on `develop` and the open PR is targeting `develop`.

Example:\n\t- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`\n\t- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n\t- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n\t- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n\t-\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n\t- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`\n\t- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`\n\t- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n\t- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://coderabbit.ai/docs) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](https://discord.com/invite/GsXnASn26c) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->",

The main changes include the implementation of an `is_admin` flag for user accounts, which distinguishes between admin and non-admin users. This flag is crucial for controlling access to specific operations through the REST interface, ensuring that only admins can perform sensitive actions.\n\nAdmin users are granted exclusive permissions to list all users, create new users, access and modify other users' information, deactivate or delete user accounts. In contrast, regular users are limited to managing their own account details and activating a user account. These restrictions are designed to safeguard the system against unauthorized access and modifications, enhancing overall security.\n\nThe PR also specifies that these new access controls are implemented in a manner that does not interfere with existing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) functionalities, particularly within the ZenML Cloud environment. This ensures that the new features can coexist with the current RBAC system without causing any disruptions or conflicts.\n\nTo support these changes, the PR includes updates to documentation, the addition of tests to cover the new functionalities, and modifications to various components of the system, including CLI commands, models, and server utilities. The contributor has followed the project's contribution guidelines, ensuring that the new branch is based on `develop` and that all pre-requisites for a successful PR have been met.\n\n### Comments Summary\n\nThe PR received feedback from a reviewer, avishniakov, who suggested improvements for the unit tests and conducted a thorough local test to assess the impact of the changes on the dashboard. The reviewer identified several areas for improvement, particularly regarding the creation and updating of user accounts through the Client/CLI and the dashboard. These include the inability to set or change a user's admin status upon account creation or update, and the need for the dashboard to reflect a user's admin status accurately.\n\nThe reviewer also highlighted a potential vulnerability where a non-admin user could elevate their status to admin during the first login process. This issue was addressed, and the backend points related to user activation and admin status were fixed. However, the dashboard-related enhancements were deferred to a separate task tracked in the project's issue tracking system.\n\nStefannica, the contributor, acknowledged the feedback and incorporated the suggested improvements into the PR. The changes were re-tested and confirmed to work as expected.\n\n### AI-Generated Summary of Generated Summaries\n\nThe PR introduces an `is_admin` flag to distinguish between admin and non-admin users, applying this distinction across various components of the system, including CLI commands, client functions, models, and server utilities. Admin users are granted exclusive permissions for sensitive operations, such as user management tasks, while regular users are limited to managing their own account details.\n\nSignificant changes include the addition of the `is_admin` flag to user creation and update functions, both in the CLI and the client layer, and the introduction of this flag in various user models. The server's authentication and permission verification mechanisms have been updated to accommodate the new admin concept, ensuring that only admins can perform certain actions unless RBAC settings override these restrictions.\n\nThe database schema has been updated to include an `is_admin` column for user management, and tests have been added to cover the new functionalities and ensure that admin and non-admin users are handled correctly.

Example:\n\t- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`\n\t- `Generate unit-tests for this file.`\n\t- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n\t- `@coderabbitai generate unit tests for this file.`\n\t-\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n\t- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`\n\t- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`\n\t- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit tests.`\n\t- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- The JSON schema for the configuration file is available [here](https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/coderabbit-overrides.v2.json).\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/coderabbit-overrides.v2.json`\n\n### CodeRabbit Discord Community\n\nJoin our [Discord Community](https://discord.com/invite/GsXnASn26c) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->",

This change aims to mitigate misuse and excessive login attempts, enhancing the overall security posture of the system. The contributor has completed several preparatory steps to ensure the quality and compatibility of this change, including reading the contributing guidelines, potentially updating documentation, basing their work on the `develop` branch, and communicating necessary changes to the dashboard if required. Although the PR does not include new tests to cover the changes, it marks a significant bug fix by adding rate limiting to an area previously lacking this safeguard. The changes are categorized under bug fixes, indicating an improvement to existing functionality without introducing new features or breaking changes.\n\n### Comments Summary\n\nThe comment from `avishniakov` directly requests a review from `@coderabbitai`. This indicates a need for evaluation and feedback on the implemented changes. There are no further comments providing additional context or raising specific concerns about the PR. Thus, the primary focus from the comments is on obtaining a thorough review of the modifications made to introduce rate limiting to the login API.\n\n### AI-generated Summary of Generated Summaries\n\nThe PR introduces rate limiting to the login API by incorporating `slowapi` as an optional dependency, specified to be version `>=0.1.9` in `pyproject.toml`. In `src/zenml/zen_server/routers/auth_endpoints.py`, the changes involve importing `Limiter` and `get_remote_address` to initialize a `limiter` instance with `Limiter(key_func=get_remote_address)`. The `token` function, responsible for handling login attempts, is now decorated with a rate limit of \"5/minute;1000/day\" to prevent misuse and excessive login attempts. This enhancement is a direct response to the previously identified gap in security measures, specifically addressing the need for rate limiting to protect against potential abuse. The implementation details, including the choice of rate limits and the use of `slowapi`, reflect a targeted approach to improving the system's resilience against brute-force attacks and other forms of abuse that could compromise user security and system integrity.\n\n-->\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: short summary by coderabbit.ai --><!-- commit_ids_reviewed_start -->\n\n<!-- 32c06cb5bbdc003647756b59c6379d3c250cabc0 -->\n\n<!-- commit_ids_reviewed_end --><!-- tweet_start -->\n\nThank you for using CodeRabbit.

Example:\n\t- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`\n\t- `Generate unit-tests for this file.`\n\t- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n\t- `@coderabbitai generate unit tests for this file.`\n\t-\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n\t- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`\n\t- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`\n\t- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit tests.`\n\t- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks.

This is what can happen if the ZenML server or the kubernetes cluster or load balancer, or proxy is incorrectly configured:\r\n* let's say you have 100 legit users regularly logging in\r\n* let's also say you have an attacker trying to brute-force his way into the server\r\n* when incorrectly configured, the server \"sees\" all requests coming from a single IP: the IP of the proxy or load-balancer\r\n* the \"bad\" requests will pile up until the limiter starts blocking traffic from that IP address, effectively stopping everyone from logging in, even the legit users\r\n\r\nWe should still offer the limiter as a feature, because it's a great thing to have for security, but have some way of configuring it and keeping it disabled by default. If the admins enable it, it's their responsibility to correctly configure the surrounding infrastructure (proxy/load-balancer/whatever).",

The submitter has implemented a fix to ensure that the UserSchema does not allow duplicate entries at the database level, enhancing data integrity and consistency within the application's user management system.\n\nThe changes made in this PR involve the introduction of a unique constraint on the \"user\" table, specifically targeting the \"name\" and \"is_service_account\" columns to prevent the insertion of duplicate records. This modification is critical for maintaining a clean and reliable user database, especially in systems where the distinction between regular users and service accounts is vital.\n\nBefore submitting the PR, the author has adhered to several pre-requisites, including reading the contributing document, updating documentation if necessary, adding tests to cover the changes, basing their branch on `develop`, and communicating any dashboard-related changes. The types of changes introduced by this PR are categorized under \"Bug fix,\" indicating that the primary goal is to rectify an existing issue without introducing new features or breaking changes.\n\n### Comments Summary\n\nThe comment on the PR from `avishniakov` is a direct request for a review from `@coderabbitai`. This indicates that the PR is ready for evaluation and possibly requires expertise or insights from the mentioned reviewer. There are no additional comments providing further context or feedback on the PR, suggesting that the discussion is in its early stages or that the changes are straightforward enough not to warrant immediate concerns or questions from other contributors.\n\n### AI-Generated Summary of Generated Summaries\n\nThe PR introduces a set of changes aimed at enhancing the uniqueness constraints within the user management system of the application. Specifically, a migration script has been added to enforce a unique constraint on the \"name\" and \"is_service_account\" columns of the \"user\" table, ensuring that duplicate entries are prevented at the database level. This is further supported by modifications in the `UserSchema` within `user_schemas.py`, where a `UniqueConstraint` has been explicitly defined to uphold this requirement.\n\nAdditionally, the PR includes updates to the `sql_zen_store.py` file, where transaction management has been improved through the use of `try-except` blocks specifically designed to catch `IntegrityError`. This enhancement not only aids in handling exceptions more effectively but also updates the logic for checking existing entities before their creation, thereby reinforcing the overall integrity and reliability of the user data management process.\n\nIn summary, PR 2483 focuses on fixing an issue related to user data duplication by implementing unique constraints and improving exception handling mechanisms, thereby ensuring the integrity and uniqueness of user records in the database.\n\n-->\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: short summary by coderabbit.ai --><!-- commit_ids_reviewed_start -->\n\n<!-- 135c2e05e7350f1b49ccddcf450e6533143900a7 -->\n\n<!-- commit_ids_reviewed_end --><!-- tweet_start -->\n\nThank you for using CodeRabbit.

The submitter has identified and fixed a race condition that allowed for the creation of duplicate usernames, which is a significant bug fix enhancing the system's integrity and reliability.\n\nThe changes made include adjustments to the conditional checks during the user and service account creation process to prevent duplicates from occurring even under heavy load. This fix is crucial for maintaining the uniqueness of usernames across the system, which is fundamental for user identification and management.\n\nThe contributor has followed all the necessary pre-requisites for submitting the PR, including reading the contributing document, updating documentation if required, adding tests to cover the changes, basing the new branch on `develop`, and communicating any dashboard changes. The type of change is categorized under \"Bug fix,\" indicating that it resolves an issue without introducing new features or breaking existing functionality.\n\n### Comments Summary\n\nIn the comments section of the PR, there are two notable interactions:\n\n1. **GitGuardian Alert**: A comment from `avishniakov` highlights an alert from GitGuardian, which detected a hardcoded secret in the pull request. However, this was immediately addressed by the commenter as a false positive. This interaction is crucial as it concerns security and the integrity of the codebase, but since it's identified as a false positive, it doesn't impact the PR's review process directly.\n\n2. **Review Request**: `strickvl` has requested a review from `coderabbitai`. This indicates that the PR is ready for further examination and evaluation by peers or automated systems to ensure the changes meet the project's standards and effectively address the issue at hand.\n\n### AI-Generated Summary of Generated Summaries\n\nThe pull request introduces modifications primarily within the `sql_zen_store.py` file and the integration tests to address a race condition issue that allowed the creation of duplicate usernames during high concurrency scenarios. The core changes involve enhancing the logic for checking the existence of entities before committing their creation to the database and refining error handling related to entity existence checks. Specifically, the adjustments ensure that during the creation process of users and service accounts, the system now correctly identifies and prevents the creation of duplicates, thereby maintaining the uniqueness and integrity of usernames.\n\nAdditionally, the integration tests have been expanded to include new tests that simulate the parallel creation of users and service accounts, ensuring that the fixes are effective and that such race conditions are appropriately handled. These tests leverage threading to mimic concurrent requests, providing a robust validation for the changes made.\n\nIn summary, the PR effectively addresses a significant race condition issue by refining the entity creation process and enhancing the system's ability to handle high concurrency scenarios without compromising the uniqueness of usernames.

Example:\n\t- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`\n\t- `Generate unit-tests for this file.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n\t- `@coderabbitai generate unit tests for this file.`\n\t-\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n\t- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository from git and render them as a table.`\n\t- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`\n\t- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit tests.`\n\t- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- The JSON schema for the configuration file is available [here](https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/coderabbit-overrides.v2.json).\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/coderabbit-overrides.v2.json`\n\n### CodeRabbit Discord Community\n\nJoin our [Discord Community](https://discord.com/invite/GsXnASn26c) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->",

A dashboard update is required to pass the current password to the call made to the API (handled with https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml-dashboard/pull/556)\r\n\r\n## Pre-requisites\r\nPlease ensure you have done the following:\r\n- [x] I have read the **CONTRIBUTING.md** document.\r\n- [ ] If my change requires a change to docs, I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n- [ ] I have added tests to cover my changes.\r\n- [x] I have based my new branch on `develop` and the open PR is targeting `develop`.

The main changes include the implementation of an `is_admin` flag for user accounts, which distinguishes between admin and non-admin users. This flag is crucial for controlling access to specific operations through the REST interface, ensuring that only admins can perform sensitive actions.\n\nAdmin users are granted exclusive permissions to list all users, create new users, access and modify other users' information, deactivate or delete user accounts. In contrast, regular users are limited to managing their own account details and activating a user account. These restrictions are designed to safeguard the system against unauthorized access and modifications, enhancing overall security.\n\nThe PR also specifies that these new access controls are implemented in a manner that does not interfere with existing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) functionalities, particularly within the ZenML Cloud environment. This ensures that the new features can coexist with the current RBAC system without causing any disruptions or conflicts.\n\nTo support these changes, the PR includes updates to documentation, the addition of tests to cover the new functionalities, and modifications to various components of the system, including CLI commands, models, and server utilities. The contributor has followed the project's contribution guidelines, ensuring that the new branch is based on `develop` and that all pre-requisites for a successful PR have been met.\n\n### Comments Summary\n\nThe PR received feedback from a reviewer, avishniakov, who suggested improvements for the unit tests and conducted a thorough local test to assess the impact of the changes on the dashboard. The reviewer identified several areas for improvement, particularly regarding the creation and updating of user accounts through the Client/CLI and the dashboard. These include the inability to set or change a user's admin status upon account creation or update, and the need for the dashboard to reflect a user's admin status accurately.\n\nThe reviewer also highlighted a potential vulnerability where a non-admin user could elevate their status to admin during the first login process. This issue was addressed, and the backend points related to user activation and admin status were fixed. However, the dashboard-related enhancements were deferred to a separate task tracked in the project's issue tracking system.\n\nStefannica, the contributor, acknowledged the feedback and incorporated the suggested improvements into the PR. The changes were re-tested and confirmed to work as expected.\n\n### AI-Generated Summary of Generated Summaries\n\nThe PR introduces an `is_admin` flag to distinguish between admin and non-admin users, applying this distinction across various components of the system, including CLI commands, client functions, models, and server utilities. Admin users are granted exclusive permissions for sensitive operations, such as user management tasks, while regular users are limited to managing their own account details.\n\nSignificant changes include the addition of the `is_admin` flag to user creation and update functions, both in the CLI and the client layer, and the introduction of this flag in various user models. The server's authentication and permission verification mechanisms have been updated to accommodate the new admin concept, ensuring that only admins can perform certain actions unless RBAC settings override these restrictions.\n\nThe database schema has been updated to include an `is_admin` column for user management, and tests have been added to cover the new functionalities and ensure that admin and non-admin users are handled correctly. The PR also addresses a potential security vulnerability related to user activation and admin status elevation.\n\nDashboard-related enhancements, such as reflecting a user's admin status and modifying user creation and update functionalities to include admin status settings, have been identified but are to be addressed in a separate task.\n\n-->\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: short summary by coderabbit.ai --><!-- commit_ids_reviewed_start -->\n\n<!-- 5c4545713838f0b28edfea7c9768339d2d899c2d -->\n\n<!-- commit_ids_reviewed_end --><!-- tweet_start -->\n\nThank you for using CodeRabbit.

Example:\n\t- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`\n\t- `Generate unit-tests for this file.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n\t- `@coderabbitai generate unit tests for this file.`\n\t-\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n\t- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`\n\t- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`\n\t- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit tests.`\n\t- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review.

The contributor has implemented and/or fixed certain functionalities to achieve improved isolation. The changes include extending `_sanitize_paths` in `BaseArtifactStore` to enforce boundaries, rerouting helper methods to use artifact store methods, and updating standard materializers to interact with the artifact store directly. A potential breaking change is highlighted, requiring users to ensure operations stay within Artifact Store scopes to maintain security. The contributor has followed the contributing guidelines, including adding tests, updating documentation, and basing the branch on `develop`.\n\n### Comments Summary\n\nThe comments from `avishniakov` are direct requests for `@coderabbitai` to review the pull request, indicating a general review request without specific areas of concern mentioned.\n\n### AI-Generated Summary of Generated Summaries\n\nThe PR introduces key changes to enhance ZenML's artifact store isolation:\n\n1. **Base Artifact Store Enhancements:**\n   - Added imports for `inspect` and `Path`.\n   - Implemented `_verify` for input validation.\n   - Modified `__init_subclass__` for automatic path verification.\n   - Introduced `_inner_verify` for path validation within store bounds.\n\n2. **Artifact Utilities Update (`utils.py`):**\n   - Updated `_load_file_from_artifact_store` to raise `IOError` on rejection, improving error handling.\n\n3. **Integration Test Addition (`test_base_artifact_store.py`):**\n   - Added tests to ensure operations within artifact store bounds, covering file operations.\n\nThese changes collectively strengthen artifact store isolation by enforcing boundaries, enhancing error handling, and ensuring operations are confined within designated scopes.\n\n-->\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: short summary by coderabbit.ai --><!-- commit_ids_reviewed_start -->\n\n<!-- b265c323bc8fab8cd82470795c5d7ca625f78c65 -->\n<!-- 18b1eb630f150bd7ba6439578f27e20da06b6d46 -->\n\n<!-- commit_ids_reviewed_end --><!-- tweet_start -->\n\nThank you for using CodeRabbit.

Specifically, it applies rate limiting to authentication endpoints, ensuring they can only be accessed a certain number of times per minute or day. This measure helps protect the server from potential overload or attack by regulating access frequency.\n\n## Changes\n\n| File Path                        | Change Summary                                         |\n|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| `pyproject.toml`                 | Added `slowapi` as an optional dependency (`>=0.1.9`). |\n| `.../zen_server/routers/auth_endpoints.py` | Imported `Limiter` and `get_remote_address` from `slowapi`; initialized `limiter` with `Limiter(key_func=get_remote_address)`; added rate limiting (`5/minute;1000/day`) to the `token` function. |\n\n> 🐰✨  \n> In the land of code and might,  \n> A new guard rises, shining bright.  \n> \"Slow and steady,\" it firmly said,  \n> Keeping the server safe, ahead.  \n> With every hop, it sets the pace,  \n> Ensuring all find their rightful place.  \n> 🌟🐾\n\n<!-- walkthrough_end --><!-- This is an auto-generated comment: raw summary by coderabbit.ai -->\n<!--\n\n\npyproject.toml: ## Short summary\n\nAdded `slowapi` as an optional dependency with version `>=0.1.9`.\n\nsrc/zenml/zen_server/routers/auth_endpoints.py: ## Short summary\n\nAdded import statements for `Limiter` and `get_remote_address`.

This change aims to mitigate misuse and excessive login attempts, enhancing the overall security posture of the system. The contributor has completed several preparatory steps to ensure the quality and compatibility of this change, including reading the contributing guidelines, potentially updating documentation, basing their work on the `develop` branch, and communicating necessary changes to the dashboard if required. Although the PR does not include new tests to cover the changes, it marks a significant bug fix by adding rate limiting to an area previously lacking this safeguard. The changes are categorized under bug fixes, indicating an improvement to existing functionality without introducing new features or breaking changes.\n\n### Comments Summary\n\nThe comment from `avishniakov` directly requests a review from `@coderabbitai`. This indicates a need for evaluation and feedback on the implemented changes. There are no further comments providing additional context or raising specific concerns about the PR. Thus, the primary focus from the comments is on obtaining a thorough review of the modifications made to introduce rate limiting to the login API.\n\n### AI-generated Summary of Generated Summaries\n\nThe PR introduces rate limiting to the login API by incorporating `slowapi` as an optional dependency, specified to be version `>=0.1.9` in `pyproject.toml`. In `src/zenml/zen_server/routers/auth_endpoints.py`, the changes involve importing `Limiter` and `get_remote_address` to initialize a `limiter` instance with `Limiter(key_func=get_remote_address)`. The `token` function, responsible for handling login attempts, is now decorated with a rate limit of \"5/minute;1000/day\" to prevent misuse and excessive login attempts. This enhancement is a direct response to the previously identified gap in security measures, specifically addressing the need for rate limiting to protect against potential abuse. The implementation details, including the choice of rate limits and the use of `slowapi`, reflect a targeted approach to improving the system's resilience against brute-force attacks and other forms of abuse that could compromise user security and system integrity.\n\n-->\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: short summary by coderabbit.ai --><!-- commit_ids_reviewed_start -->\n\n<!-- 32c06cb5bbdc003647756b59c6379d3c250cabc0 -->\n\n<!-- commit_ids_reviewed_end --><!-- tweet_start -->\n\nThank you for using CodeRabbit.

This is what can happen if the ZenML server or the kubernetes cluster or load balancer, or proxy is incorrectly configured:\r\n* let's say you have 100 legit users regularly logging in\r\n* let's also say you have an attacker trying to brute-force his way into the server\r\n* when incorrectly configured, the server \"sees\" all requests coming from a single IP: the IP of the proxy or load-balancer\r\n* the \"bad\" requests will pile up until the limiter starts blocking traffic from that IP address, effectively stopping everyone from logging in, even the legit users\r\n\r\nWe should still offer the limiter as a feature, because it's a great thing to have for security, but have some way of configuring it and keeping it disabled by default. If the admins enable it, it's their responsibility to correctly configure the surrounding infrastructure (proxy/load-balancer/whatever).",

It modifies the schema to include this constraint and enhances the transaction management in the SQL store. Exception handling is improved with specific attention to `IntegrityError`, streamlining the process of checking for existing entities before their creation.\n\n## Changes\n\n| File Path                         | Change Summary                                                           |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `.../migrations/versions/72675226b2de_unique_users.py` | Adds a migration script for unique constraint on `user` table.          |\n| `.../zen_stores/schemas/user_schemas.py`               | Introduces `UniqueConstraint` in `UserSchema`.                           |\n| `.../zen_stores/sql_zen_store.py`                       | Enhances transaction management and exception handling for entity creation. |\n\n> 🐇✨  \n> To the database, we hop and bound,  \n> With unique users, no duplicates found.  \n> Try and catch, we gracefully manage,  \n> Ensuring integrity, with no damage.  \n> So here's to changes, both big and small,  \n> May our code run smoothly, bugs none at all.  \n> 🌟🐾\n\n<!-- walkthrough_end --><!-- This is an auto-generated comment: raw summary by coderabbit.ai -->\n<!--\n\n\nsrc/zenml/zen_stores/migrations/versions/72675226b2de_unique_users.py: This file introduces a migration script that adds a unique constraint to the \"user\" table on columns \"name\" and \"is_service_account.\"\n\n---\n\nsrc/zenml/zen_stores/schemas/user_schemas.py: Added a `UniqueConstraint` to the `UserSchema` table definition in `user_schemas.py`.\n\n---\n\nsrc/zenml/zen_stores/sql_zen_store.py: \n- The code now uses `try-except` blocks with `IntegrityError` handling for transaction management.\n- The logic for checking existing entities before creation has been updated to handle exceptions more effectively.\n\n-->\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: raw summary by coderabbit.ai --><!-- This is an auto-generated comment: short summary by coderabbit.ai -->\n<!--\n\n\n### PR Objectives\n\nThe pull request (PR) number 2483, titled \"Uniquely constrained users table,\" aims to address an issue related to the duplication of user data in the database. The submitter has implemented a fix to ensure that the UserSchema does not allow duplicate entries at the database level, enhancing data integrity and consistency within the application's user management system.\n\nThe changes made in this PR involve the introduction of a unique constraint on the \"user\" table, specifically targeting the \"name\" and \"is_service_account\" columns to prevent the insertion of duplicate records. This modification is critical for maintaining a clean and reliable user database, especially in systems where the distinction between regular users and service accounts is vital.\n\nBefore submitting the PR, the author has adhered to several pre-requisites, including reading the contributing document, updating documentation if necessary, adding tests to cover the changes, basing their branch on `develop`, and communicating any dashboard-related changes. The types of changes introduced by this PR are categorized under \"Bug fix,\" indicating that the primary goal is to rectify an existing issue without introducing new features or breaking changes.\n\n### Comments Summary\n\nThe comment on the PR from `avishniakov` is a direct request for a review from `@coderabbitai`. This indicates that the PR is ready for evaluation and possibly requires expertise or insights from the mentioned reviewer. There are no additional comments providing further context or feedback on the PR, suggesting that the discussion is in its early stages or that the changes are straightforward enough not to warrant immediate concerns or questions from other contributors.\n\n### AI-Generated Summary of Generated Summaries\n\nThe PR introduces a set of changes aimed at enhancing the uniqueness constraints within the user management system of the application. Specifically, a migration script has been added to enforce a unique constraint on the \"name\" and \"is_service_account\" columns of the \"user\" table, ensuring that duplicate entries are prevented at the database level. This is further supported by modifications in the `UserSchema` within `user_schemas.py`, where a `UniqueConstraint` has been explicitly defined to uphold this requirement.\n\nAdditionally, the PR includes updates to the `sql_zen_store.py` file, where transaction management has been improved through the use of `try-except` blocks specifically designed to catch `IntegrityError`. This enhancement not only aids in handling exceptions more effectively but also updates the logic for checking existing entities before their creation, thereby reinforcing the overall integrity and reliability of the user data management process.\n\nIn summary, PR 2483 focuses on fixing an issue related to user data duplication by implementing unique constraints and improving exception handling mechanisms, thereby ensuring the integrity and uniqueness of user records in the database.\n\n-->\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: short summary by coderabbit.ai --><!-- commit_ids_reviewed_start -->\n\n<!-- 135c2e05e7350f1b49ccddcf450e6533143900a7 -->\n\n<!-- commit_ids_reviewed_end --><!-- tweet_start -->\n\nThank you for using CodeRabbit.

The changes ensure entities are uniquely created without duplication even when multiple requests are made in parallel, alongside improved error handling for entity existence.\n\n## Changes\n\n| File Path                                               | Change Summary                                                                 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `src/zenml/.../sql_zen_store.py`                        | Enhanced entity creation order, existence checks, and error handling.          |\n| `tests/integration/functional/zen_stores/.../test_zen_store.py` | Added tests for parallel user and service account creation without duplication.|\n\n> 🐇✨  \n> In the realm of code where the data flows,  \n> A rabbit hopped, fixing bugs in rows.  \n> No duplicates found, in parallel they thrive,  \n> Ensuring entities uniquely arrive.  \n> With each hop and leap, the code does improve,  \n> In the ZenML land, smooth and on the move.  \n> 🌟🐾\n\n<!-- walkthrough_end --><!-- This is an auto-generated comment: raw summary by coderabbit.ai -->\n<!--\n\n\nsrc/zenml/zen_stores/sql_zen_store.py: ## Short summary\n\nIn the `sql_zen_store.py` file, the changes involve reordering the creation of entities within a session, checking for existing entities before committing, adjusting error handling for entity existence.\n\n---\n\ntests/integration/functional/zen_stores/test_zen_store.py: ## Short summary\n\n- Added import for `threading`.\n- Added import for `UserFilter`.\n- Added a new test `test_creating_users_in_parallel_do_not_duplicate_fails` to test creating users in parallel without duplication.\n- Added a new test `test_creating_service_accounts_in_parallel_do_not_duplicate_fails` to test creating service accounts in parallel without duplication.\n\n-->\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: raw summary by coderabbit.ai --><!-- This is an auto-generated comment: short summary by coderabbit.ai -->\n<!--\n\n\n### PR Objectives\n\nThe pull request (PR) #2479 addresses a critical issue related to the creation of new users and service accounts under heavy race conditions, such as when there are 100 simultaneous requests to create a new user. The submitter has identified and fixed a race condition that allowed for the creation of duplicate usernames, which is a significant bug fix enhancing the system's integrity and reliability.\n\nThe changes made include adjustments to the conditional checks during the user and service account creation process to prevent duplicates from occurring even under heavy load. This fix is crucial for maintaining the uniqueness of usernames across the system, which is fundamental for user identification and management.\n\nThe contributor has followed all the necessary pre-requisites for submitting the PR, including reading the contributing document, updating documentation if required, adding tests to cover the changes, basing the new branch on `develop`, and communicating any dashboard changes. The type of change is categorized under \"Bug fix,\" indicating that it resolves an issue without introducing new features or breaking existing functionality.\n\n### Comments Summary\n\nIn the comments section of the PR, there are two notable interactions:\n\n1. **GitGuardian Alert**: A comment from `avishniakov` highlights an alert from GitGuardian, which detected a hardcoded secret in the pull request. However, this was immediately addressed by the commenter as a false positive. This interaction is crucial as it concerns security and the integrity of the codebase, but since it's identified as a false positive, it doesn't impact the PR's review process directly.\n\n2. **Review Request**: `strickvl` has requested a review from `coderabbitai`. This indicates that the PR is ready for further examination and evaluation by peers or automated systems to ensure the changes meet the project's standards and effectively address the issue at hand.\n\n### AI-Generated Summary of Generated Summaries\n\nThe pull request introduces modifications primarily within the `sql_zen_store.py` file and the integration tests to address a race condition issue that allowed the creation of duplicate usernames during high concurrency scenarios. The core changes involve enhancing the logic for checking the existence of entities before committing their creation to the database and refining error handling related to entity existence checks. Specifically, the adjustments ensure that during the creation process of users and service accounts, the system now correctly identifies and prevents the creation of duplicates, thereby maintaining the uniqueness and integrity of usernames.\n\nAdditionally, the integration tests have been expanded to include new tests that simulate the parallel creation of users and service accounts, ensuring that the fixes are effective and that such race conditions are appropriately handled. These tests leverage threading to mimic concurrent requests, providing a robust validation for the changes made.\n\nIn summary, the PR effectively addresses a significant race condition issue by refining the entity creation process and enhancing the system's ability to handle high concurrency scenarios without compromising the uniqueness of usernames. The inclusion of targeted integration tests further ensures the reliability and effectiveness of these changes.\n\n-->\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: short summary by coderabbit.ai --><!-- commit_ids_reviewed_start -->\n\n<!-- 618770b84cc75d2478070fc47a6a7da2848668ae -->\n\n<!-- commit_ids_reviewed_end --><!-- tweet_start -->\n\nThank you for using CodeRabbit.

Example:\n\t- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`\n\t- `Generate unit-tests for this file.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n\t- `@coderabbitai generate unit tests for this file.`\n\t-\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n\t- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository from git and render them as a table.`\n\t- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`\n\t- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit tests.`\n\t- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- The JSON schema for the configuration file is available [here](https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/coderabbit-overrides.v2.json).\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/coderabbit-overrides.v2.json`\n\n### CodeRabbit Discord Community\n\nJoin our [Discord Community](https://discord.com/invite/GsXnASn26c) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->",

        "README_content": "# [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) — New Wave JavaScript\n\nMeetings are currently held on the [matrix.org platform](https://matrix.to/#/#jquery_meeting:gitter.im).\n\nMeeting minutes can be found at [meetings.jquery.org](https://meetings.jquery.org/category/core/).\n\nThe latest version of jQuery is available at [https://jquery.com/download/](https://jquery.com/download/).\n\n## Version support\n\n| Version | Branch     | Status   |\n| ------- | ---------- | -------- |\n| 4.x     | main       | Beta     |\n| 3.x     | 3.x-stable | Active   |\n| 2.x     | 2.x-stable | Inactive |\n| 1.x     | 1.x-stable | Inactive |\n\nOnce 4.0.0 final is released, the 3.x branch will continue to receive updates for a limited time. The 2.x and 1.x branches are no longer supported.\n\nCommercial support for inactive versions is available from [HeroDevs](https://herodevs.com/nes).\n\nLearn more about our [version support](https://jquery.com/support/).\n\n## Contribution Guides\n\nIn the spirit of open source software development, jQuery always encourages community code contribution. To help you get started and before you jump into writing code, be sure to read these important contribution guidelines thoroughly:\n\n1. [Getting Involved](https://contribute.jquery.org/)\n2. [Core Style Guide](https://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/)\n3. [Writing Code for jQuery Projects](https://contribute.jquery.org/code/)\n\n### References to issues/PRs\n\nGitHub issues/PRs are usually referenced via `gh-NUMBER`, where `NUMBER` is the numerical ID of the issue/PR. You can find such an issue/PR under `https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/NUMBER`.\n\njQuery has used a different bug tracker - based on Trac - in the past, available under [bugs.jquery.com](https://bugs.jquery.com/). It is being kept in read only mode so that referring to past discussions is possible. When jQuery source references one of those issues, it uses the pattern `trac-NUMBER`, where `NUMBER` is the numerical ID of the issue. You can find such an issue under `https://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/NUMBER`.\n\n## Environments in which to use jQuery\n\n- [Browser support](https://jquery.com/browser-support/)\n- jQuery also supports Node, browser extensions, and other non-browser environments.\n\n## What you need to build your own jQuery\n\nTo build jQuery, you need to have the latest Node.js/npm and git 1.7 or later. Earlier versions might work, but are not supported.\n\nFor Windows, you have to download and install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).\n\nmacOS users should install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Once Homebrew is installed, run `brew install git` to install git,\nand `brew install node` to install Node.js.\n\nLinux/BSD users should use their appropriate package managers to install git and Node.js, or build from source\nif you swing that way. Easy-peasy.\n\n## How to build your own jQuery\n\nFirst, [clone the jQuery git repo](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).\n\nThen, enter the jquery directory, install dependencies, and run the build script:\n\n```bash\ncd jquery\nnpm install\nnpm run build\n```\n\nThe built version of jQuery will be placed in the `dist/` directory, along with a minified copy and associated map file.\n\n## Build all jQuery release files\n\nTo build all variants of jQuery, run the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build:all\n```\n\nThis will create all of the variants that jQuery includes in a release, including `jquery.js`, `jquery.slim.js`, `jquery.module.js`, and `jquery.slim.module.js` along their associated minified files and sourcemaps.\n\n`jquery.module.js` and `jquery.slim.module.js` are [ECMAScript modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) that export `jQuery` and `$` as named exports are placed in the `dist-module/` directory rather than the `dist/` directory.\n\n## Building a Custom jQuery\n\nThe build script can be used to create a custom version of jQuery that includes only the modules you need.\n\nAny module may be excluded except for `core`. When excluding `selector`, it is not removed but replaced with a small wrapper around native `querySelectorAll` (see below for more information).\n\n### Build Script Help\n\nTo see the full list of available options for the build script, run the following:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build -- --help\n```\n\n### Modules\n\nTo exclude a module, pass its path relative to the `src` folder (without the `.js` extension) to the `--exclude` option. When using the `--include` option, the default includes are dropped and a build is created with only those modules.\n\nSome example modules that can be excluded or included are:\n\n- **ajax**: All AJAX functionality: `$.ajax()`, `$.get()`, `$.post()`, `$.ajaxSetup()`, `.load()`, transports, and ajax event shorthands such as `.ajaxStart()`.\n- **ajax/xhr**: The XMLHTTPRequest AJAX transport only.\n- **ajax/script**: The `<script>` AJAX transport only; used to retrieve scripts.\n- **ajax/jsonp**: The JSONP AJAX transport only; depends on the ajax/script transport.\n- **css**: The `.css()` method. Also removes **all** modules depending on css (including **effects**, **dimensions**, and **offset**).\n- **css/showHide**: Non-animated `.show()`, `.hide()` and `.toggle()`; can be excluded if you use classes or explicit `.css()` calls to set the `display` property. Also removes the **effects** module.\n- **deprecated**: Methods documented as deprecated but not yet removed.\n- **dimensions**: The `.width()` and `.height()` methods, including `inner-` and `outer-` variations.\n- **effects**: The `.animate()` method and its shorthands such as `.slideUp()` or `.hide(\"slow\")`.\n- **event**: The `.on()` and `.off()` methods and all event functionality.\n- **event/trigger**: The `.trigger()` and `.triggerHandler()` methods.\n- **offset**: The `.offset()`, `.position()`, `.offsetParent()`, `.scrollLeft()`, and `.scrollTop()` methods.\n- **wrap**: The `.wrap()`, `.wrapAll()`, `.wrapInner()`, and `.unwrap()` methods.\n- **core/ready**: Exclude the ready module if you place your scripts at the end of the body. Any ready callbacks bound with `jQuery()` will simply be called immediately. However, `jQuery(document).ready()` will not be a function and `.on(\"ready\", ...)` or similar will not be triggered.\n- **deferred**: Exclude jQuery.Deferred. This also excludes all modules that rely on Deferred, including **ajax**, **effects**, and **queue**, but replaces **core/ready** with **core/ready-no-deferred**.\n- **exports/global**: Exclude the attachment of global jQuery variables ($ and jQuery) to the window.\n- **exports/amd**: Exclude the AMD definition.\n\n- **selector**: The full jQuery selector engine. When this module is excluded, it is replaced with a rudimentary selector engine based on the browser's `querySelectorAll` method that does not support jQuery selector extensions or enhanced semantics. See the [selector-native.js](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/main/src/selector-native.js) file for details.\n\n*Note*: Excluding the full `selector` module will also exclude all jQuery selector extensions (such as `effects/animatedSelector` and `css/hiddenVisibleSelectors`).\n\n##### AMD name\n\nYou can set the module name for jQuery's AMD definition. By default, it is set to \"jquery\", which plays nicely with plugins and third-party libraries, but there may be cases where you'd like to change this. Pass it to the `--amd` parameter:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build -- --amd=\"custom-name\"\n```\n\nOr, to define anonymously, leave the name blank.\n\n```bash\nnpm run build -- --amd\n```\n\n##### File name and directory\n\nThe default name for the built jQuery file is `jquery.js`; it is placed under the `dist/` directory. It's possible to change the file name using `--filename` and the directory using `--dir`. `--dir` is relative to the project root.\n\n```bash\nnpm run build -- --slim --filename=\"jquery.slim.js\" --dir=\"/tmp\"\n```\n\nThis would create a slim version of jQuery and place it under `tmp/jquery.slim.js`.\n\n##### ECMAScript Module (ESM) mode\n\nBy default, jQuery generates a regular script JavaScript file. You can also generate an ECMAScript module exporting `jQuery` as the default export using the `--esm` parameter:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build -- --filename=jquery.module.js --esm\n```\n\n##### Factory mode\n\nBy default, jQuery depends on a global `window`. For environments that don't have one, you can generate a factory build that exposes a function accepting `window` as a parameter that you can provide externally (see [`README` of the published package](build/fixtures/README.md) for usage instructions). You can generate such a factory using the `--factory` parameter:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build -- --filename=jquery.factory.js --factory\n```\n\nThis option can be mixed with others like `--esm` or `--slim`:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build -- --filename=jquery.factory.slim.module.js --factory --esm --slim --dir=\"/dist-module\"\n```\n\n#### Custom Build Examples\n\nCreate a custom build using `npm run build`, listing the modules to be excluded. Excluding a top-level module also excludes its corresponding directory of modules.\n\nExclude all **ajax** functionality:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build -- --exclude=ajax\n```\n\nExcluding **css** removes modules depending on CSS: **effects**, **offset**, **dimensions**.\n\n```bash\nnpm run build -- --exclude=css\n```\n\nExclude a bunch of modules (`-e` is an alias for `--exclude`):\n\n```bash\nnpm run build -- -e ajax/jsonp -e css -e deprecated -e dimensions -e effects -e offset -e wrap\n```\n\nThere is a special alias to generate a build with the same configuration as the official jQuery Slim build:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build -- --filename=jquery.slim.js --slim\n```\n\nOr, to create the slim build as an esm module:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build -- --filename=jquery.slim.module.js --slim --esm\n```\n\n*Non-official custom builds are not regularly tested. Use them at your own risk.*\n\n## Running the Unit Tests\n\nMake sure you have the necessary dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\n\nStart `npm start` to auto-build jQuery as you work:\n\n```bash\nnpm start\n```\n\nRun the unit tests with a local server that supports PHP. Ensure that you run the site from the root directory, not the \"test\" directory. No database is required. Pre-configured php local servers are available for Windows and Mac. Here are some options:\n\n- Windows: [WAMP download](https://www.wampserver.com/en/)\n- Mac: [MAMP download](https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/)\n- Linux: [Setting up LAMP](https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/easy-lamp-server-installation/)\n- [Mongoose (most platforms)](https://code.google.com/p/mongoose/)\n\n## Essential Git\n\nAs the source code is handled by the Git version control system, it's useful to know some features used.\n\n### Cleaning\n\nIf you want to purge your working directory back to the status of upstream, the following commands can be used (remember everything you've worked on is gone after these):\n\n```bash\ngit reset --hard upstream/main\ngit clean -fdx\n```\n\n### Rebasing\n\nFor feature/topic branches, you should always use the `--rebase` flag to `git pull`, or if you are usually handling many temporary \"to be in a github pull request\" branches, run the following to automate this:\n\n```bash\ngit config branch.autosetuprebase local\n```\n\n(see `man git-config` for more information)\n\n### Handling merge conflicts\n\nIf you're getting merge conflicts when merging, instead of editing the conflicted files manually, you can use the feature\n`git mergetool`. Even though the default tool `xxdiff` looks awful/old, it's rather useful.\n\nThe following are some commands that can be used there:\n\n- `Ctrl + Alt + M` - automerge as much as possible\n- `b` - jump to next merge conflict\n- `s` - change the order of the conflicted lines\n- `u` - undo a merge\n- `left mouse button` - mark a block to be the winner\n- `middle mouse button` - mark a line to be the winner\n- `Ctrl + S` - save\n- `Ctrl + Q` - quit\n\n## [QUnit](https://api.qunitjs.com) Reference\n\n### Test methods\n\n```js\nexpect( numAssertions );\nstop();\nstart();\n```\n\n*Note*: QUnit's eventual addition of an argument to stop/start is ignored in this test suite so that start and stop can be passed as callbacks without worrying about their parameters.\n\n### Test assertions\n\n```js\nok( value, [message] );\nequal( actual, expected, [message] );\nnotEqual( actual, expected, [message] );\ndeepEqual( actual, expected, [message] );\nnotDeepEqual( actual, expected, [message] );\nstrictEqual( actual, expected, [message] );\nnotStrictEqual( actual, expected, [message] );\nthrows( block, [expected], [message] );\n```\n\n## Test Suite Convenience Methods Reference\n\nSee [test/data/testinit.js](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/main/test/data/testinit.js).\n\n### Returns an array of elements with the given IDs\n\n```js\nq( ... );\n```\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nq( \"main\", \"foo\", \"bar\" );\n\n=> [ div#main, span#foo, input#bar ]\n```\n\n### Asserts that a selection matches the given IDs\n\n```js\nt( testName, selector, [ \"array\", \"of\", \"ids\" ] );\n```\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nt(\"Check for something\", \"//[a]\", [\"foo\", \"bar\"]);\n```\n\n### Fires a native DOM event without going through jQuery\n\n```js\nfireNative( node, eventType );\n```\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nfireNative( jQuery( \"#elem\" )[ 0 ], \"click\" );\n```\n\n### Add random number to url to stop caching\n\n```js\nurl( \"some/url\" );\n```\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nurl( \"index.html\" );\n\n=> \"data/index.html?10538358428943\"\n\n\nurl( \"mock.php?foo=bar\" );\n\n=> \"data/mock.php?foo=bar&10538358345554\"\n```\n\n### Run tests in an iframe\n\nSome tests may require a document other than the standard test fixture, and\nthese can be run in a separate iframe. The actual test code and assertions\nremain in jQuery's main test files; only the minimal test fixture markup\nand setup code should be placed in the iframe file.\n\n```js\ntestIframe( testName, fileName,\n  function testCallback(\n      assert, jQuery, window, document,\n\t  [ additional args ] ) {\n\t...\n  } );\n```\n\nThis loads a page, constructing a url with fileName `\"./data/\" + fileName`.\nThe iframed page determines when the callback occurs in the test by\nincluding the \"/test/data/iframeTest.js\" script and calling\n`startIframeTest( [ additional args ] )` when appropriate. Often this\nwill be after either document ready or `window.onload` fires.\n\nThe `testCallback` receives the QUnit `assert` object created by `testIframe`\nfor this test, followed by the global `jQuery`, `window`, and `document` from\nthe iframe. If the iframe code passes any arguments to `startIframeTest`,\nthey follow the `document` argument.\n\n## Questions?\n\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to ask on the\n[Developing jQuery Core forum](https://forum.jquery.com/developing-jquery-core) or in #jquery on [libera](https://web.libera.chat/).\n",

The jsonpickle project makes no formal\nguarantee for any older maintenance tracks to receive updates.\nIn practice, though, critical vulnerability fixes can be applied not\nonly to the most recent track, but to at least a couple more\nmaintenance tracks if requested by users.\n\n## Security\n\nThe jsonpickle module **is not secure**.  Only unpickle data you trust.\n\nIt is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will **execute\narbitrary code during unpickling**.  Never unpickle data that could have come\nfrom an untrusted source, or that could have been tampered with.\n\nConsider signing data with an HMAC if you need to ensure that it has not\nbeen tampered with.\n\nSafer deserialization approaches, such as reading JSON directly,\nmay be more appropriate if you are processing untrusted data.\n",

Note the usage of jsonpickle.encode and decode, and how the data is written/encoded to a file and then read/decoded from the file.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import jsonpickle\n    from dataclasses import dataclass\n   \n    @dataclass\n    class Example:\n        data: str\n   \n   \n    ex = Example(\"value1\")\n    encoded_instance = jsonpickle.encode(ex)\n    assert encoded_instance == '{\"py/object\": \"__main__.Example\", \"data\": \"value1\"}'\n   \n    with open(\"example.json\", \"w+\") as f:\n        f.write(encoded_instance)\n   \n    with open(\"example.json\", \"r+\") as f:\n        written_instance = f.read()\n        decoded_instance = jsonpickle.decode(written_instance)\n    assert decoded_instance == ex\n\nFor more examples, see the `examples directory on GitHub <https://github.com/jsonpickle/jsonpickle/tree/main/examples>`_ for example scripts. These can be run on your local machine to see how jsonpickle works and behaves, and how to use it. Contributions from users regarding how they use jsonpickle are welcome!\n\n\nWhy jsonpickle?\n===============\n\nData serialized with python's pickle (or cPickle or dill) is not easily readable outside of python. Using the json format, jsonpickle allows simple data types to be stored in a human-readable format, and more complex data types such as numpy arrays and pandas dataframes, to be machine-readable on any platform that supports json. E.g., unlike pickled data, jsonpickled data stored in an Amazon S3 bucket is indexible by Amazon's Athena.\n\nSecurity\n========\n\njsonpickle should be treated the same as the\n`Python stdlib pickle module <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html>`_\nfrom a security perspective.\n\n.. warning::\n\n   The jsonpickle module **is not secure**.  Only unpickle data you trust.\n\n   It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will **execute\n   arbitrary code during unpickling**.  Never unpickle data that could have come\n   from an untrusted source, or that could have been tampered with.\n\n   Consider signing data with an HMAC if you need to ensure that it has not\n   been tampered with.\n\n   Safer deserialization approaches, such as reading JSON directly,\n   may be more appropriate if you are processing untrusted data.\n\n\nInstall\n=======\n\nInstall from pip for the latest stable release:\n\n::\n\n    pip install jsonpickle\n\nInstall from github for the latest changes:\n\n::\n\n    pip install git+https://github.com/jsonpickle/jsonpickle.git\n\n\nNumpy/Pandas Support\n====================\n\njsonpickle includes built-in numpy and pandas extensions.  If you would\nlike to encode sklearn models, numpy arrays, pandas DataFrames, and other\nnumpy/pandas-based data, then you must enable the numpy and/or pandas\nextensions by registering their handlers::\n\n    >>> import jsonpickle.ext.numpy as jsonpickle_numpy\n    >>> import jsonpickle.ext.pandas as jsonpickle_pandas\n    >>> jsonpickle_numpy.register_handlers()\n    >>> jsonpickle_pandas.register_handlers()\n\n\nDevelopment\n===========\n\nUse `make` to run the unit tests::\n\n        make test\n\n`pytest` is used to run unit tests internally.\n\nA `tox` target is provided to run tests using all installed and supported Python versions::\n\n        make tox\n\n`jsonpickle` itself has no dependencies beyond the Python stdlib.\n`tox` is required for testing when using the `tox` test runner only.\n\nThe testing requirements are specified in `setup.cfg`.\nIt is recommended to create a virtualenv and run tests from within the\nvirtualenv.::\n\n        python3 -mvenv env3\n        source env3/bin/activate\n        pip install --editable '.[dev]'\n        make test\n\nYou can also use a tool such as `vx <https://github.com/davvid/vx/>`_\nto activate the virtualenv without polluting your shell environment::\n\n        python3 -mvenv env3\n        vx env3 pip install --editable '.[dev]'\n        vx env3 make test\n\nIf you can't use a venv, you can install the testing packages as follows::\n\n        pip install .[testing]\n\n`jsonpickle` supports multiple Python versions, so using a combination of\nmultiple virtualenvs and `tox` is useful in order to catch compatibility\nissues when developing.\n\nGPG Signing\n===========\n\nUnfortunately, while versions of jsonpickle before 3.0.1 should still be signed, GPG signing support was removed from PyPi (https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2023-05-23-removing-pgp/) back in May 2023.\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nLicensed under the BSD License.

                "body": "Currently, I want to remove support for Python 2.7, 3.5, and 3.6, as both have reached their End of Life date. The PSF stated that **EOL CPython versions receive no further security updates**, and any codebase using them is advised to migrate to a newer version. I'm thinking that CPython 3.8+ would be a sensible target, as that lets us use walrus operators (``:=``) in the code as well as the nice ``f\"{expr}=\"`` syntax for f-strings ([since both of those were introduced in 3.8](https://docs.python.org/3.8/whatsnew/3.8.html)). Also, for speed implications, the [CPython 3.9 Whatsnew has a nice graph of how much faster some basic operations got between 3.7 and 3.8](https://docs.python.org/3.9/whatsnew/3.9.html#optimizations).\r\n\r\nAny dropping of multiple EOL CPython versions would probably occur in a jsonpickle 3.0 release, so likely not for at least another few months. For reference, [here's a chart of EOL CPython versions](https://endoflife.date/python). 3.6 hit EOL 2 weeks ago, and 3.7 hits EOL in June 2023 so it would be reasonable to keep supporting 3.7 for a while longer (I'm just trying to minimize the number of major version bumps we need, since we'll eventually need to drop support for 3.7). 2.7 and 3.5 absolutely do not need to be supported, as 2.7 hit EOL 2 years ago, and 3.5 hit it 1.25 years ago.\r\n\r\n@davvid Can you check the PyPi stats for jsonpickle to see how many weekly/monthly downloads the package gets from 2.7, 3.6, and 3.7? The 3.x series isn't super relevant since it's an easy upgrade from 3.5/3.6 to 3.8+, and 3.7 to 3.8 is essentially drop-in. I'd be interested to see how many people have yet to make the switch though.\r\n\r\nLastly, do any users of jsonpickle have a reason they'd like to see support for 3.6 and/or 3.7 in the library in the near future? I think a valid case for 3.7 would be pretty easy to make, and 3.6 support could possibly be kept if a lot of people still use it.",

You could attempt to sanitize the input server-side yourself, but personally, I suspect this task is daunting to do _correctly_ and would be better spent using the stdlib's json module to specifically and manually reanimate your data structures.\r\n\r\nWhen I first wrote jsonpickle in 2008 it was merely my exploration of the Python object model -- attempting to persist arbitrary graphs of Python objects and restore them via the JSON format, which only allows strings, numbers, booleans, lists, dicts, & null. At that time, very few tools provided native JSON-serialization (whereas now we have a plethora of native methods like Keras' `model.to_json()`). @davvid and numerous other authors have made the system incredibly more advanced, and I doubt that any of my original code exists at this point.  What follows is my opinion as an \"alumni\" of the project that others may disagree with.  \r\n\r\nI have occasionally thought about a \"Jurassic Park\" line when I look back to 2008:\r\n> Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn’t stop to think if they should.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn isolation, jsonpickle is a reasonable tool, but it is likely a security issue for some dependent projects. I am happy to see tools and researchers help developers see an extra warning flag outside of the documentation.  As @j0lt-github recently did, providing a proof of concept of an RCE. \r\n\r\nI am glad dependency scanning tools like snyk exist and it is the first tool I'm aware of to identify jsonpickle as a risk. However, it would be more ideal if static code analysis tools were aware of jsonpickle and could help a package author reason if jsonpickle is getting untrusted input or not.\r\n\r\nSimilar to Python's own `pickle`, which snyk also notes ([9. Deserialize selectively](https://snyk.io/blog/python-security-best-practices-cheat-sheet/)), jsonpickle allows for the arbitrary content that is then reanimated into Python objects in memory. Given the dynamic nature of Python and the natural challenges of sandboxing it, I can not envision a path forward that would allow jsonpickle to work while simultaneously sanitizing an arbitrary object graph.  jsonpickle is more similar to the browser's `eval()` than `JSON.parse()`.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the jsonpickle project could consider several improvements:\r\n* In the documentation, provide further guidance of when it may be appropriate and inappropriate to use jsonpickle. My personal fear is a novice developer making a website who googles \"pickle JSON\" and does not understand what \"untrusted data\" means.\r\n* Re-consider the inclusion of jsonpickleJS as part of this repository (or organization). The jsonpickle maintainers may disagree, but personally, this feels like an endorsement of a possibly dangerous architectural pattern.\r\n* Work with security researchers & products to attempt to add static code analysis of calls to jsonpickle, the same way they alert of calls to `pickle`",

Regarding jsonpickleJS, moving it into a `contrib/` subdirectory with a new README in that directory that clearly outlines the dangers and generally discourages its use for most applications might be a nice middle-ground.  I dunno, maybe removing it and linking back to the original project, alongside adequate warning and guidance, is better because then we don't actually carry the JS code around with us and it makes it clear that there are many security pitfalls when accepting arbitrary input.\r\n\r\nOne approach to making jsonpickle more safe that I was going to look into pursuing in the future (unless someone beats me to it or has a better idea) was going to be the addition of a new `allow_imports={None/set/list/tuple}` argument for both `encode()` and `decode()`.\r\n\r\nThe `decode()` implementation would be the most beneficial security-wise of the two, but we'd want the feature for both.  When `allow_imports` is non-empty then we would *only* import modules and types that `fnmatch` the patterns specified by the user.  Any requests to import something that was not allowed would throw a ValueError exception with a message specifying which name could not be imported.\r\n\r\nThat would allow users to do something like `allow_imports=['my_package.*']` and then jsonpickle will only allow importing stuff from `my_package`.  For now, throwing an exception seems best since all-or-nothing is a sensible approach for this feature.\r\n\r\nFor `encode()`, the same mechanism can prevent json from being emitted altogether.  It can also throw a ValueError exception when it gets asked to encode an object which would result in importing objects that are outside the `allow_imports` set/tuple/list.\r\n\r\nRegarding eval and literal_eval -- we do use `literal_eval` in a few places, but `loadrepr()` seems to be the only place where we call `eval()` as a fallback code path and rely on being able to eval the `repr()` representation of an object.  That functionality could also be made to respect `allow_imports` by enforcing that both the module name and the repr string itself (note that the encoded representation has it as `<module>/<repr>`) have to be specified in `allow_imports`.\r\n\r\nRegarding security researchers -- I'd be happy to work with security researchers to have jsonpickle calls get flagged as being as dangerous as pickle but I don't have any contacts.  If there's anyone we can reach out to that'd be a good thing to do; please let me know if you know of any projects we should approach.  If we had something like `allow_imports` then one thing they could flag in the future would be any code that doesn't supply the argument.\r\n\r\nWhat do y'all think?",

The classic security vs. convenience trade-off comes to mind in that a user might be annoyed that they have to enumerate everything they allow, but it's still better than the alternative where the feature becomes a footgun.\r\n\r\n`loadrepr()` seems like it'd be pretty darn hard to use with allow-lists without wildcards, so having a way to disable the `eval()` code path completely might be a better idea than trying to make it usable, it seems.\r\n\r\nYeah, it's true that sandboxing python is an extremely hard problem so I'm not sure whether or not allow-lists would be a useful feature in general.  Giving users a false sense of security is not good and we definitely don't want such a feature to be interpreted as a silver bullet or remedy for dangerous architectures.

Please update\nyour references to `https://github.com/pallets-eco/flask-admin.git`.\n\n[![image](https://d322cqt584bo4o.cloudfront.net/flask-admin/localized.svg)](https://crowdin.com/project/flask-admin) [![image](https://github.com/pallets-eco/flask-admin/actions/workflows/tests.yaml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/pallets-eco/flask-admin/actions/workflows/test.yaml)\n\n## Pallets Community Ecosystem\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\\\n> This project is part of the Pallets Community Ecosystem. Pallets is the open\n> source organization that maintains Flask; Pallets-Eco enables community\n> maintenance of related projects. If you are interested in helping maintain\n> this project, please reach out on [the Pallets Discord server][discord].\n\n[discord]: https://discord.gg/pallets\n\n## Introduction\n\nFlask-Admin is a batteries-included, simple-to-use\n[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) extension that lets you add admin\ninterfaces to Flask applications. It is inspired by the *django-admin*\npackage, but implemented in such a way that the developer has total\ncontrol over the look, feel, functionality and user experience of the resulting\napplication.\n\nOut-of-the-box, Flask-Admin plays nicely with various ORM\\'s, including\n\n-   [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)\n-   [pymongo](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/)\n-   and [Peewee](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee).\n\nIt also boasts a simple file management interface and a [Redis\nclient](https://redis.io/) console.\n\nThe biggest feature of Flask-Admin is its flexibility. It aims to provide a\nset of simple tools that can be used to build admin interfaces of\nany complexity. To start off, you can create a very simple\napplication in no time, with auto-generated CRUD-views for each of your\nmodels. Then you can further customize those views and forms as\nthe need arises.\n\nFlask-Admin is an active project, well-tested and production-ready.\n\n## Examples\n\nSeveral usage examples are included in the */examples* folder. Please\nadd your own, or improve on the existing examples, and submit a\n*pull-request*.\n\nTo run the examples in your local environment:\n1. Clone the repository:\n\n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/pallets-eco/flask-admin.git\n    cd flask-admin\n    ```\n2. Create and activate a virtual environment:\n\n    ```bash\n    # Windows:\n    python -m venv .venv\n    .venv\\Scripts\\activate\n\n    # Linux:\n    python3 -m venv .venv\n    source .venv/bin/activate\n    ```\n3. Install requirements:\n\n    ```bash\n    pip install -r examples/sqla/requirements.txt\n    ```\n4. Run the application:\n\n    ```bash\n    python examples/sqla/run_server.py\n    ```\n5. Check the Flask app running on <http://localhost:5000>.\n\n## Documentation\n\nFlask-Admin is extensively documented, you can find all of the\ndocumentation at <https://flask-admin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>.\n\nThe docs are auto-generated from the *.rst* files in the */doc* folder.\nIf you come across any errors or if you think of anything else that\nshould be included, feel free to make the changes and submit a *pull-request*.\n\nTo build the docs in your local environment, from the project directory:\n\n    tox -e docs-html\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install Flask-Admin, simply:\n\n    pip install flask-admin\n\nOr alternatively, you can download the repository and install manually\nby doing:\n\n    git clone https://github.com/pallets-eco/flask-admin.git\n    cd flask-admin\n    pip install .\n\n## Tests\n\nTests are run with *pytest*. If you are not familiar with this package, you can find out more on [their website](https://pytest.org/).\n\nTo run the tests, from the project directory, simply run:\n\n    pip install --use-pep517 -r requirements/dev.txt\n    pytest\n\nYou should see output similar to:\n\n    .............................................\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Ran 102 tests in 13.132s\n\n    OK\n\n**NOTE!** For all the tests to pass successfully, you\\'ll need Postgres (with\nthe postgis and hstore extension) & MongoDB to be running locally. You'll\nalso need *libgeos* available.\n\nFor Postgres:\n```bash\npsql postgres\n> CREATE DATABASE flask_admin_test;\n> # Connect to database \"flask_admin_test\":\n> \\c flask_admin_test;\n> CREATE EXTENSION postgis;\n> CREATE EXTENSION hstore;\n```\nIf you\\'re using Homebrew on MacOS, you might need this:\n\n```bash\n# Install postgis and geos\nbrew install postgis\nbrew install geos\n\n# Set up a PostgreSQL user\ncreateuser -s postgresql\nbrew services restart postgresql\n```\n\nYou can also run the tests on multiple environments using *tox*.\n\n## 3rd Party Stuff\n\nFlask-Admin is built with the help of\n[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/),\n[Select2](https://github.com/ivaynberg/select2) and\n[Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/).\n\nIf you want to localize your application, install the\n[Flask-Babel](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Flask-Babel) package.\n\nYou can help improve Flask-Admin\\'s translations through Crowdin:\n<https://crowdin.com/project/flask-admin>\n",

Check out [LangChain.js](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs).\n\nTo help you ship LangChain apps to production faster, check out [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com).\n[LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com) is a unified developer platform for building, testing, and monitoring LLM applications.\nFill out [this form](https://www.langchain.com/contact-sales) to speak with our sales team.\n\n## Quick Install\n\nWith pip:\n\n```bash\npip install langchain\n```\n\nWith conda:\n\n```bash\nconda install langchain -c conda-forge\n```\n\n## 🤔 What is LangChain?\n\n**LangChain** is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs).\n\nFor these applications, LangChain simplifies the entire application lifecycle:\n\n- **Open-source libraries**: Build your applications using LangChain's open-source [building blocks](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/#langchain-expression-language-lcel), [components](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/), and [third-party integrations](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/providers/).\n  Use [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) to build stateful agents with first-class streaming and human-in-the-loop support.\n- **Productionization**: Inspect, monitor, and evaluate your apps with [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) so that you can constantly optimize and deploy with confidence.\n- **Deployment**: Turn your LangGraph applications into production-ready APIs and Assistants with [LangGraph Cloud](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/).\n\n### Open-source libraries\n\n- **`langchain-core`**: Base abstractions and LangChain Expression Language.\n- **`langchain-community`**: Third party integrations.\n  - Some integrations have been further split into **partner packages** that only rely on **`langchain-core`**. Examples include **`langchain_openai`** and **`langchain_anthropic`**.\n- **`langchain`**: Chains, agents, and retrieval strategies that make up an application's cognitive architecture.\n- **[`LangGraph`](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/)**: A library for building robust and stateful multi-actor applications with LLMs by modeling steps as edges and nodes in a graph. Integrates smoothly with LangChain, but can be used without it. To learn more about LangGraph, check out our first LangChain Academy course, *Introduction to LangGraph*, available [here](https://academy.langchain.com/courses/intro-to-langgraph).\n\n### Productionization:\n\n- **[LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/)**: A developer platform that lets you debug, test, evaluate, and monitor chains built on any LLM framework and seamlessly integrates with LangChain.\n\n### Deployment:\n\n- **[LangGraph Cloud](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/)**: Turn your LangGraph applications into production-ready APIs and Assistants.\n\n![Diagram outlining the hierarchical organization of the LangChain framework, displaying the interconnected parts across multiple layers.](docs/static/svg/langchain_stack_062024.svg \"LangChain Architecture Overview\")\n\n## 🧱 What can you build with LangChain?\n\n**❓ Question answering with RAG**\n\n- [Documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/rag/)\n- End-to-end Example: [Chat LangChain](https://chat.langchain.com) and [repo](https://github.com/langchain-ai/chat-langchain)\n\n**🧱 Extracting structured output**\n\n- [Documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/extraction/)\n- End-to-end Example: [SQL Llama2 Template](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-extract/)\n\n**🤖 Chatbots**\n\n- [Documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/chatbot/)\n- End-to-end Example: [Web LangChain (web researcher chatbot)](https://weblangchain.vercel.app) and [repo](https://github.com/langchain-ai/weblangchain)\n\nAnd much more! Head to the [Tutorials](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/) section of the docs for more.\n\n## 🚀 How does LangChain help?\n\nThe main value props of the LangChain libraries are:\n\n1. **Components**: composable building blocks, tools and integrations for working with language models. Components are modular and easy-to-use, whether you are using the rest of the LangChain framework or not\n2. **Off-the-shelf chains**: built-in assemblages of components for accomplishing higher-level tasks\n\nOff-the-shelf chains make it easy to get started. Components make it easy to customize existing chains and build new ones.\n\n## LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)\n\nLCEL is a key part of LangChain, allowing you to build and organize chains of processes in a straightforward, declarative manner. It was designed to support taking prototypes directly into production without needing to alter any code. This means you can use LCEL to set up everything from basic \"prompt + LLM\" setups to intricate, multi-step workflows.\n\n- **[Overview](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/#langchain-expression-language-lcel)**: LCEL and its benefits\n- **[Interface](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/#runnable-interface)**: The standard Runnable interface for LCEL objects\n- **[Primitives](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/#langchain-expression-language-lcel)**: More on the primitives LCEL includes\n- **[Cheatsheet](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/lcel_cheatsheet/)**: Quick overview of the most common usage patterns\n\n## Components\n\nComponents fall into the following **modules**:\n\n**📃 Model I/O**\n\nThis includes [prompt management](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/#prompt-templates), [prompt optimization](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/#example-selectors), a generic interface for [chat models](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/#chat-models) and [LLMs](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/#llms), and common utilities for working with [model outputs](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/#output-parsers).\n\n**📚 Retrieval**\n\nRetrieval Augmented Generation involves [loading data](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/#document-loaders) from a variety of sources, [preparing it](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/#text-splitters), then [searching over (a.k.a. retrieving from)](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/#retrievers) it for use in the generation step.\n\n**🤖 Agents**\n\nAgents allow an LLM autonomy over how a task is accomplished. Agents make decisions about which Actions to take, then take that Action, observe the result, and repeat until the task is complete. LangChain provides a [standard interface for agents](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/#agents), along with [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) for building custom agents.\n\n## 📖 Documentation\n\nPlease see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation, which includes:\n\n- [Introduction](https://python.langchain.com/docs/introduction/): Overview of the framework and the structure of the docs.\n- [Tutorials](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/): If you're looking to build something specific or are more of a hands-on learner, check out our tutorials.

                        "body": "_🤖_\n<!-- Greeting -->\nHello @Vegoo89,\n\nI'm [Dosu](https://dosu.dev), an automated assistant here to help you with your issues, answer questions, and guide you in becoming a contributor while we wait for a human maintainer. I'm here to make your experience with LangChain as smooth as possible. Let's get started with your issue!\n\n<!-- Answer -->\nThank you for bringing this to our attention. The `PythonREPL` component, which currently exists in the base library, can indeed be moved exclusively to the `experimental` version of `langchain` to address security concerns. This can be done by moving the entire `PythonREPL` class definition to the appropriate file in the `experimental` version of the library.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. Cut the entire `PythonREPL` class from the `libs/langchain/langchain/utilities/python.py` file.\n\n```py\nclass PythonREPL(BaseModel):\n    \"\"\"Simulates a standalone Python REPL.\"\"\"\n\n    globals: Optional[Dict] = Field(default_factory=dict, alias=\"_globals\")\n    locals: Optional[Dict] = Field(default_factory=dict, alias=\"_locals\")\n\n    @classmethod\n    def worker(\n        cls,\n        command: str,\n        globals: Optional[Dict],\n        locals: Optional[Dict],\n        queue: multiprocessing.Queue,\n    ) -> None:\n        old_stdout = sys.stdout\n        sys.stdout = mystdout = StringIO()\n        try:\n            exec(command, globals, locals)\n            sys.stdout = old_stdout\n            queue.put(mystdout.getvalue())\n        except Exception as e:\n            sys.stdout = old_stdout\n            queue.put(repr(e))\n\n    def run(self, command: str, timeout: Optional[int] = None) -> str:\n        \"\"\"Run command with own globals/locals and returns anything printed.\n        Timeout after the specified number of seconds.\"\"\"\n\n        # Warn against dangers of PythonREPL\n        warn_once()\n\n        queue: multiprocessing.Queue = multiprocessing.Queue()\n\n        # Only use multiprocessing if we are enforcing a timeout\n        if timeout is not None:\n            # create a Process\n            p = multiprocessing.Process(\n                target=self.worker, args=(command, self.globals, self.locals, queue)\n            )\n\n            # start it\n            p.start()\n\n            # wait for the process to finish or kill it after timeout seconds\n            p.join(timeout)\n\n            if p.is_alive():\n                p.terminate()\n                return \"Execution timed out\"\n        else:\n            self.worker(command, self.globals, self.locals, queue)\n        # get the result from the worker function\n        return queue.get()\n```\n\n2. Paste the `PythonREPL` class into the appropriate file in the `experimental` version of the library.\n\nRemember to also move any dependencies that `PythonREPL` has, such as the `warn_once` function and any imported modules, to ensure that the class continues to function correctly.\n\nThis issue has been addressed before in the LangChain repository. You can refer to the following issues and pull requests for more information:\n\n- [Issue: what string works for experimental tool](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/issues/13856)\n- [Remove `python_repl` from _BASE_TOOLS](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/pull/13962)\n- [Remove `python_repl` from _BASE_TOOLS (#13962)](https://github.com/Nghiauet/langchain/commit/5ccdf94985f8fd6c16aa7b65e2708415cbf175c7)\n\nPlease let me know if you need further assistance.\n\n## Sources\n- [Issue: what string works for experimental tool](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/issues/13856)\n- [libs/langchain/langchain/utilities/python.py](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/master/libs/langchain/langchain/utilities/python.py)\n\n---\n\nThis response is meant to be useful and save you time.

                        "body": "_Answer generated by a 🤖_\n## Answer\nI understand your concern about the potential security vulnerability in the LLMMathChain class of LangChain. You've correctly identified that the `numexpr.evaluate` function, which is used in the `_evaluate_expression` method, could potentially execute arbitrary code if a malicious expression is passed to it. This is due to the fact that `numexpr.evaluate` uses Python's `eval` function, which can execute arbitrary Python code.\n\nHere's the code snippet in question:\n\n```py\ndef _evaluate_expression(self, expression: str) -> str:\n    try:\n        local_dict = {\"pi\": math.pi, \"e\": math.e}\n        output = str(\n            numexpr.evaluate(\n                expression.strip(),\n                global_dict={},  # restrict access to globals\n                local_dict=local_dict,  # add common mathematical functions\n            )\n        )\n    except Exception as e:\n        raise ValueError(\n            f'LLMMathChain._evaluate(\"{expression}\") raised error: {e}.'\n            \" Please try again with a valid numerical expression\"\n        )\n\n    # Remove any leading and trailing brackets from the output\n    return re.sub(r\"^\\[|\\]$\", \"\", output)\n```\n\nIn this code, `numexpr.evaluate` is called with the `expression` argument, which could potentially contain malicious code. Although the `global_dict` argument is set to an empty dictionary to restrict access to global variables, and the `local_dict` argument is set to a dictionary containing common mathematical functions, this does not prevent the execution of arbitrary code.\n\nThis means that a malicious user could potentially execute arbitrary code on the server where LangChain is running by passing a specially crafted expression to the `LLMMathChain`'s `run` method. This is indeed a serious security issue that needs to be addressed.\n\nHowever, please note that this is just one potential interpretation of the issue. If you believe this interpretation is correct and that this is a bug that could impact other users, I encourage you to make a pull request to address this issue. If your experience contradicts this interpretation, I would suggest upgrading to the latest version of LangChain to see if the issue persists.\n\n## Sources\n- [libs/langchain/langchain/chains/llm_math/base.py](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/-/libs/langchain/langchain/chains/llm_math/base.py)\n\n---\nThis response is meant to be useful, save you time, and share context. It is **not meant to be a precise solution**, but rather a starting point for your own research.\n\nHelp me be more useful! Please leave a 👍 if this is helpful and 👎 if it is irrelevant.",

It's a common alternative to `eval` / `numexpr` (see this thread on vulnerabilities in [numexpr](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10076300/python-using-sympy-sympify-to-perform-a-safe-eval-on-mathematical-functions)). As well as avoiding that vulnerability, `sympy` also supports a much larger range of mathematical operations (i.e. rounding, factorials, etc.) and is about 10x as common as `numexpr` (as measured by github stars), so I'd guess its easier for an LLM to generate syntactically correct input (in fact, I spent about 10mins trying to get GPT-3 to generate a mathematical input that `sympy` *couldn't* process, and failed).\r\n\r\nI was testing some multi-step QA workflows inspired by a Langchain multi-step agent QA [workflow](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/how_to/intermediate_steps), and was using the `llm-math` tool in an Agent chain, with prompts like: \"Who is Zoe Saldana's partner? What is their current age raised to the 0.43 power, rounded to 3sf?\". This would cause `numexpr` to throw an error, since the chain would try and fail to pass it some kind of rounding instruction.  This also happens with the factorial function in #3071. Both of these use cases are fixed by backing `LLMMathChain` with a `sympify` call.\r\n\r\nHappy to attach some examples / create a PR to scope out the replacement if people agree. It's what I've been using locally and it works great!",

Additionally, once we publish our code on GitHub, GitHub Dependabot will flag these security vulnerabilities, and we need to address auto-cut tickets for our team. \r\n\r\nSo, it would be much easier, and safer, to ship code with zero security vulnerabilities in downstream dependencies.

We felt this was the best solution for the time being, and may reconsider moving the code back to `langchain` itself once we're satisfied with the interface and security profile it offers.\r\n\r\nAs the discussion here and in #6051 pointed out, the most thorough and most universally-compatible way to prevent undesirable SQL commands from being executed is to limit the database permissions granted to the chain. That way, the database itself prevents dangerous commands like `DROP TABLE` from being able to be executed. As a result, we're marking that `langchain-experimental` code with prominent security warnings advising users about the security risk and reminding them to limit the database permissions they grant the chain: #9867\r\n\r\nThanks for the report and the productive discussion here!",

We will move the current python tools and anything that depends on them into `langchain.experimental` and make that a separate package. This should remove CVEs from core langchain, while also hopefullying making it clear its experimental, and also allowing for prototyping\r\n2. I would encourage the creation of a separate `langchain_python` or the like respository where that uses wasm by default. we'd be happy to support this in a variety of ways (help setting up, help publicizing, help maintaining), but i think we'd prefer it to be a separate repository\r\n\r\nthoughts?",

                "body": "### Issue you'd like to raise.\r\n\r\n\r\nTL;DR: The use of exec() in agents can lead to remote code execution vulnerabilities. Some Huggingface projects use such agents, despite the potential harm of LLM-generated Python code.\r\n\r\n\r\n#1026 and #814 discuss the security concerns regarding the use of `exec()` in llm_math chain.  The comments in #1026 proposed methods to sandbox the code execution, but due to environmental issues, the code was patched to replace `exec()` with `numexpr.evaluate()` (#2943). This restricted the execution capabilities to mathematical functionalities only. This bug was assigned the CVE number CVE-2023-29374. \r\n\r\nAs shown in the above issues, the usage of `exec()` in a chain can pose a significant security risk, especially when the chain is running on a remote machine. This seems common scenario for projects in Huggingface. \r\n\r\nHowever, in the latest langchain, `exec()` is still used in `PythonReplTool` and `PythonAstReplTool`. \r\nhttps://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/blob/aec642febb3daa7dbb6a19996aac2efa92bbf1bd/langchain/tools/python/tool.py#L55\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/blob/aec642febb3daa7dbb6a19996aac2efa92bbf1bd/langchain/tools/python/tool.py#L102\r\n\r\nThese functions are called by Pandas Dataframe Agent, Spark Dataframe Agent, CSV Agent. It seems they are intentionally designed to pass the LLM output to `PythonAstTool` or `PythonAstReplTool` to execute the LLM-generated code in the machine.\r\n\r\nThe documentation for these agents explicitly states that they should be used with caution since LLM-generated Python code can be potentially harmful. For instance:\r\nhttps://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/blob/aec642febb3daa7dbb6a19996aac2efa92bbf1bd/docs/modules/agents/toolkits/examples/pandas.ipynb#L12\r\n\r\nDespite this, I have observed several projects in Huggingface using `create_pandas_dataframe_agent` and `create_csv_agent`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Suggestion:\r\n\r\n\r\nFixing this issue as done in llm_math chain seems challenging.\r\nSimply restricting the LLM-generated code to Pandas and Spark execution might not be sufficient because there are still numerous malicious tasks that can be performed using those APIs. For instance, Pandas can read and write files.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, it seems crucial to emphasize the security concerns related to LLM-generated code for the overall security of LLM apps. Merely limiting execution to specific frameworks or APIs may not fully address the underlying security risks. \r\n\r\n",

The documentation for this tool does not provide a warning about its potential safety concerns. (https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/agents/tools/examples/bash.html?highlight=shell)\r\n\r\nHowever, within the code itself, there is a cautionary message stating that it may be unsafe to use the tool.\r\nhttps://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/blob/99a1e3f3a309852da989af080ba47288dcb9a348/langchain/tools/shell/tool.py#L32-L35\r\n\r\nIt would be advisable to include a warning in the documentation to alert users about the potential risks involved.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, when utilizing the shell tool in an LLM application running on a server, it is possible for malicious users to exploit it, gaining control over the shell command execution and potentially running arbitrary code on the server. Similarly, if the LLM application is running on a local machine and receives untrusted data as input, such as a malicious webpage or untrusted files, the generated shell command by the LLM can be manipulated by this untrusted data, enabling the execution of arbitrary code on the local machine. It is crucial to be aware of these security risks when using the shell tool in such scenarios.\r\n",

The `PythonREPL` component, which currently exists in the base library, can indeed be moved exclusively to the `experimental` version of `langchain` to address security concerns. This can be done by moving the entire `PythonREPL` class definition to the appropriate file in the `experimental` version of the library.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. Cut the entire `PythonREPL` class from the `libs/langchain/langchain/utilities/python.py` file.\n\n```py\nclass PythonREPL(BaseModel):\n    \"\"\"Simulates a standalone Python REPL.\"\"\"\n\n    globals: Optional[Dict] = Field(default_factory=dict, alias=\"_globals\")\n    locals: Optional[Dict] = Field(default_factory=dict, alias=\"_locals\")\n\n    @classmethod\n    def worker(\n        cls,\n        command: str,\n        globals: Optional[Dict],\n        locals: Optional[Dict],\n        queue: multiprocessing.Queue,\n    ) -> None:\n        old_stdout = sys.stdout\n        sys.stdout = mystdout = StringIO()\n        try:\n            exec(command, globals, locals)\n            sys.stdout = old_stdout\n            queue.put(mystdout.getvalue())\n        except Exception as e:\n            sys.stdout = old_stdout\n            queue.put(repr(e))\n\n    def run(self, command: str, timeout: Optional[int] = None) -> str:\n        \"\"\"Run command with own globals/locals and returns anything printed.\n        Timeout after the specified number of seconds.\"\"\"\n\n        # Warn against dangers of PythonREPL\n        warn_once()\n\n        queue: multiprocessing.Queue = multiprocessing.Queue()\n\n        # Only use multiprocessing if we are enforcing a timeout\n        if timeout is not None:\n            # create a Process\n            p = multiprocessing.Process(\n                target=self.worker, args=(command, self.globals, self.locals, queue)\n            )\n\n            # start it\n            p.start()\n\n            # wait for the process to finish or kill it after timeout seconds\n            p.join(timeout)\n\n            if p.is_alive():\n                p.terminate()\n                return \"Execution timed out\"\n        else:\n            self.worker(command, self.globals, self.locals, queue)\n        # get the result from the worker function\n        return queue.get()\n```\n\n2. Paste the `PythonREPL` class into the appropriate file in the `experimental` version of the library.\n\nRemember to also move any dependencies that `PythonREPL` has, such as the `warn_once` function and any imported modules, to ensure that the class continues to function correctly.\n\nThis issue has been addressed before in the LangChain repository.

Unexpected crashes may occur.\n\n### Extra Dependencies\n\nExtra dependencies are non-essential packages that enable additional features of pyLoad.\n\nTo install them you have to append a specific tag name to the installation command.\n\n#### Available tags\n\n-   `plugins`: includes packages used by several plugins.\n-   `build`: includes packages used to [build translations](#build-translations).\n-   `all`: includes both plugins and build packages.\n\nYou can use a tag in this way:\n\n    pip install pyload-ng[plugins]\n\nOr group more together:\n\n    pip install pyload-ng[plugins][build]\n\n### Build Translations\n\nUse the command `build_locale` to retrieve and build the latest locale files (translations):\n\n    python setup.py build_locale\n\nInvoke `build_locale` before building the package (eg. `bdist_wheel`).\n\n> **Note**:\n>\n> You don't need to build the translations if you installed pyLoad through `pip`, they're already included.\n\n## Report a Vulnerability\n\nPlease refer to [SECURITY](https://github.com/pyload/pyload/blob/main/SECURITY.md) to read our security policy.\n\n## Contribute to pyLoad\n\nPlease refer to [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/pyload/pyload/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to read our contribution guidelines.\n\n## Docker Images\n\n[![Docker build status](https://img.shields.io/docker/build/pyload/pyload?style=flat-square)](https://hub.docker.com/r/pyload/pyload)\n[![MicroBadger layers](https://img.shields.io/microbadger/layers/pyload/pyload?style=flat-square)](https://microbadger.com/images/pyload/pyload)\n[![MicroBadger size](https://img.shields.io/microbadger/image-size/pyload/pyload?style=flat-square)](https://microbadger.com/images/pyload/pyload)\n\n#### Available images\n\n-   `pyload/pyload:alpine`: docker image for amd64, arm and arm64v8.\n-   `pyload/pyload:ubuntu-arm32v7`: docker image for arm32v7.\n-   `pyload/pyload`: alias of `pyload/pyload:alpine`.\n\n### Create Container\n\n    docker create --name=pyload -v <USERDIR>:/config -v <STORAGEDIR>:/downloads --restart unless-stopped pyload/pyload\n\n> **Note**:\n>\n> Replace `<STORAGEDIR>` with the location on the host machine where you want that downloads will be saved.\n>\n> Replace `<USERDIR>` with where you want that user data files (configurations) are stored.\n\n### Start Container\n\n    docker start pyload\n\n### Stop Container\n\n    docker stop pyload\n\n### Show Logs\n\n    docker logs -f pyload\n\n### Docker Compose\n\nCompatible with `docker-compose` v2 schemas:\n\n    ---\n    version: '2'\n    services:\n      pyload:\n        image: pyload\n        build: <REPODIR>\n        container_name: pyload\n        environment:\n          -

By using it, you agree to cede\ncontrol over minutiae of hand-formatting. In return, _Black_ gives you speed,\ndeterminism, and freedom from `pycodestyle` nagging about formatting. You will save time\nand mental energy for more important matters.\n\nBlackened code looks the same regardless of the project you're reading. Formatting\nbecomes transparent after a while and you can focus on the content instead.\n\n_Black_ makes code review faster by producing the smallest diffs possible.\n\nTry it out now using the [Black Playground](https://black.vercel.app). Watch the\n[PyCon 2019 talk](https://youtu.be/esZLCuWs_2Y) to learn more.\n\n---\n\n**[Read the documentation on ReadTheDocs!](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable)**\n\n---\n\n## Installation and usage\n\n### Installation\n\n_Black_ can be installed by running `pip install black`. It requires Python 3.9+ to run.\nIf you want to format Jupyter Notebooks, install with `pip install \"black[jupyter]\"`.\n\nIf you can't wait for the latest _hotness_ and want to install from GitHub, use:\n\n`pip install git+https://github.com/psf/black`\n\n### Usage\n\nTo get started right away with sensible defaults:\n\n```sh\nblack {source_file_or_directory}\n```\n\nYou can run _Black_ as a package if running it as a script doesn't work:\n\n```sh\npython -m black {source_file_or_directory}\n```\n\nFurther information can be found in our docs:\n\n- [Usage and Configuration](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage_and_configuration/index.html)\n\n_Black_ is already [successfully used](https://github.com/psf/black#used-by) by many\nprojects, small and big. _Black_ has a comprehensive test suite, with efficient parallel\ntests, and our own auto formatting and parallel Continuous Integration runner. Now that\nwe have become stable, you should not expect large formatting changes in the future.\nStylistic changes will mostly be responses to bug reports and support for new Python\nsyntax. For more information please refer to\n[The Black Code Style](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/index.html).\n\nAlso, as a safety measure which slows down processing, _Black_ will check that the\nreformatted code still produces a valid AST that is effectively equivalent to the\noriginal (see the\n[Pragmatism](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html#ast-before-and-after-formatting)\nsection for details). If you're feeling confident, use `--fast`.\n\n## The _Black_ code style\n\n_Black_ is a PEP 8 compliant opinionated formatter. _Black_ reformats entire files in\nplace. Style configuration options are deliberately limited and rarely added. It doesn't\ntake previous formatting into account (see\n[Pragmatism](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html#pragmatism)\nfor exceptions).\n\nOur documentation covers the current _Black_ code style, but planned changes to it are\nalso documented. They're both worth taking a look at:\n\n- [The _Black_ Code Style: Current style](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html)\n- [The _Black_ Code Style: Future style](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/future_style.html)\n\nChanges to the _Black_ code style are bound by the Stability Policy:\n\n- [The _Black_ Code Style: Stability Policy](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/index.html#stability-policy)\n\nPlease refer to this document before submitting an issue. What seems like a bug might be\nintended behaviour.\n\n### Pragmatism\n\nEarly versions of _Black_ used to be absolutist in some respects. They took after its\ninitial author. This was fine at the time as it made the implementation simpler and\nthere were not many users anyway. Not many edge cases were reported. As a mature tool,\n_Black_ does make some exceptions to rules it otherwise holds.\n\n- [The _Black_ code style: Pragmatism](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html#pragmatism)\n\nPlease refer to this document before submitting an issue just like with the document\nabove. What seems like a bug might be intended behaviour.\n\n## Configuration\n\n_Black_ is able to read project-specific default values for its command line options\nfrom a `pyproject.toml` file. This is especially useful for specifying custom\n`--include` and `--exclude`/`--force-exclude`/`--extend-exclude` patterns for your\nproject.\n\nYou can find more details in our documentation:\n\n- [The basics: Configuration via a file](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage_and_configuration/the_basics.html#configuration-via-a-file)\n\nAnd if you're looking for more general configuration documentation:\n\n- [Usage and Configuration](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage_and_configuration/index.html)\n\n**Pro-tip**: If you're asking yourself \"Do I need to configure anything?\" the answer is\n\"No\". _Black_ is all about sensible defaults. Applying those defaults will have your\ncode in compliance with many other _Black_ formatted projects.\n\n## Used by\n\nThe following notable open-source projects trust _Black_ with enforcing a consistent\ncode style: pytest, tox, Pyramid, Django, Django Channels, Hypothesis, attrs,\nSQLAlchemy, Poetry, PyPA applications (Warehouse, Bandersnatch, Pipenv, virtualenv),\npandas, Pillow, Twisted, LocalStack, every Datadog Agent Integration, Home Assistant,\nZulip, Kedro, OpenOA, FLORIS, ORBIT, WOMBAT, and many more.\n\nThe following organizations use _Black_: Facebook, Dropbox, KeepTruckin, Lyft, Mozilla,\nQuora, Duolingo, QuantumBlack, Tesla, Archer Aviation.\n\nAre we missing anyone? Let us know.\n\n## Testimonials\n\n**Mike Bayer**, [author of `SQLAlchemy`](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/):\n\n> I can't think of any single tool in my entire programming career that has given me a\n> bigger productivity increase by its introduction. I can now do refactorings in about\n> 1% of the keystrokes that it would have taken me previously when we had no way for\n> code to format itself.\n\n**Dusty Phillips**,\n[writer](https://smile.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=dusty+phillips):\n\n> _Black_ is opinionated so you don't have to be.\n\n**Hynek Schlawack**, [creator of `attrs`](https://www.attrs.org/), core developer of\nTwisted and CPython:\n\n> An auto-formatter that doesn't suck is all I want for Xmas!\n\n**Carl Meyer**, [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) core developer:\n\n> At least the name is good.\n\n**Kenneth Reitz**, creator of [`requests`](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\nand [`pipenv`](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pipenv/):\n\n> This vastly improves the formatting of our code. Thanks a ton!\n\n## Show your style\n\nUse the badge in your project's README.md:\n\n```md\n[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)\n```\n\nUsing the badge in README.rst:\n\n```\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg\n    :target: https://github.com/psf/black\n```\n\nLooks like this:\n[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n## Contributing\n\nWelcome! Happy to see you willing to make the project better. You can get started by\nreading this:\n\n- [Contributing: The basics](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/the_basics.html)\n\nYou can also take a look at the rest of the contributing docs or talk with the\ndevelopers:\n\n- [Contributing documentation](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/index.html)\n- [Chat on Discord](https://discord.gg/RtVdv86PrH)\n\n## Change log\n\nThe log has become rather long. It moved to its own file.\n\nSee [CHANGES](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/latest/change_log.html).\n\n## Authors\n\nThe author list is quite long nowadays, so it lives in its own file.\n\nSee [AUTHORS.md](./AUTHORS.md)\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nEveryone participating in the _Black_ project, and in particular in the issue tracker,\npull requests, and social media activity, is expected to treat other people with respect\nand more generally to follow the guidelines articulated in the\n[Python Community Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/).\n\nAt the same time, humor is encouraged. In fact, basic familiarity with Monty Python's\nFlying Circus is expected. We are not savages.\n\nAnd if you _really_ need to slap somebody, do it with a fish while dancing.\n",

For instance, you can bundle additional monitoring plugins to collect specialized data\nfrom your servers.\n\nWe also welcome submissions from the community.\n\nFor information on the agent architecture and code abstractions, please refer to the\n[architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) document.\n\nSome of the tests and checks depend on on fixture file from git submodule so you should make sure you\nalso check out all the submodules:\n\n```bash\ngit submodule update --recursive --init\n```\n\n### Local Development Environment, Tests and Lint Checks\n\nThis repository utilizes ``tox`` Python project for running various lint checks and tests in\nisolated virtual environment.\n\nUnderneath, we use ``py.test`` test runner for running the tests.\n\nFor it to work, you need to have ``tox`` Python package installed on the system or inside the virtual\nenvironment which you use for the development.\n\n```bash\npip install tox\n```\n\nIn addition to that, you also need to have Python version available which is used for a particular\ntox target. By default Python 2.7 is used for the unit tests and Python 3.6 for all the lint checks.\n\nTo run all the checks you can simply run tox command:\n\n```bash\ntox\n```\n\nIn addition to that, you can also run a specific target or a set of targets using ``-e`` flag. For example:\n\n```bash\n# run all the lint targets\ntox -elint\n\n# run flake8 and mypy tox target\ntox -eflake8,mypy\n\n# run py2.7-unit-tests tox target\ntox -epy2.7-unit-tests\n\n# run coverage tox target\ntox -ecoverage\n```\n\nTo run a sub-set of tests or a single test from a test file, you can directly invoke ``pytest``\nfrom a specific tox virtual environment as shown below:\n\n```bash\n.tox/py2.7-unit-tests/bin/py.test -vv --durations=5 \"<test file>::<test class name>\" -k \"<test method name>\"\n```\n\nFor example:\n\n```bash\n# This will run all the tests in tests/unit/url_monitor_test.py file\n.tox/py2.7-unit-tests/bin/py.test -vv --durations=5 \"tests/unit/url_monitor_test.py\"\n\n# This will run all the test methods on the ``UrlMonitorTestRequest`` class in the\n# tests/unit/url_monitor_test.py file\n.tox/py2.7-unit-tests/bin/py.test -vv --durations=5 \"tests/unit/url_monitor_test.py::UrlMonitorTestRequest\"\n\n# This will run ``UrlMonitorTestRequest.test_get_request_no_headers`` test method from the\n# tests/unit/url_monitor_test.py file\n.tox/py2.7-unit-tests/bin/py.test -vv --durations=5 \"tests/unit/url_monitor_test.py::UrlMonitorTestRequest\" -k test_get_request_no_headers\n```\n\n### Continuous Integration\n\nWe run all the tox checks described above (+ more) continuously as part of our Github Actions based\nbuild system.\n\nEach push to a branch / pull request will trigger a build and a subset of the GHA jobs.\n\nAdditional jobs will run once the PR has been merged into master. The reason we do that is to\nspeed the PR builds and increase the developer feedback loop (some of the tests and checks we\nrun are slow so running them on every push to a branch would be slow and wasteful).\n\nBefore merging a pull request you need to ensure that all the checks have passed, pull\nrequest has been approved and it's in sync / up to date with latest master.\n\nWhen all the checks have passed, you should see something like this:\n\n<a href=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125088/79736603-59e77f80-82fa-11ea-9e33-b5279a030e8b.png\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125088/79736603-59e77f80-82fa-11ea-9e33-b5279a030e8b.png\" width=\"450px\" /></a>\n\nAfter the PR has been merged, you should wait for the ``benchmarks`` workflow to complete and then\ncheck our [CodeSpeed instance](https://scalyr-agent-codespeed.herokuapp.com/) to ensure there are\nno regressions in terms of the resource utilization (memory and CPU usage) and things such as\nincreased number of error or warning log lines.\n\nHere is an example which demonstrates a regression in number of error level lines being printed to\nthe agent log which likely indicates a bug / regression in the code -\nhttps://github.com/scalyr/scalyr-agent-2/pull/513#issuecomment-617228472.\n\n### Monitor Plugins\n\nMonitor plugins are one of the key features for Scalyr Agent 2.  These plugins can be used to augment the\nfunctionality of Scalyr Agent 2 beyond just copying logs and metrics.  For example, there are monitor plugins\nthat will fetch page content at a given URL and then log portions of the returned content.  Another plugin allows\nyou to execute a shell command periodically and then log the output.  Essentially, plugs can be used to implement\nany periodic monitoring task you have.\n\nWe encourage users to create their own plugins to cover features they desire.  In the near future, we will be\npublishing documentation that describes how to implement your own monitor.  And, if you feel your monitor would\nbe useful to other Scalyr customers, we encourage you to submit it to monitor collection in the `monitors/contrib`\ndirectory.\n\nTo learn how to develop plugins, please see the\n[instructions for creating a monitor plugin](docs/CREATING_MONITORS.md).\n\n### Building Packages\n\nNOTE: Docker image build instructions now in the [BUILD.md](BUILD.md)\n\nYou can use the `build_packages.py` script to build your own RPM or Debian packages.  This is often desirable\nif your company has its own yum or apt repositories, or you have modified the Scalyr Agent 2 code to suit\nsome particular need.  (Of course, if you are finding you need to modify the Scalyr Agent 2 code, we encourage you\nto submit your changes back to the main repository).\n\nYou must have the following installed on your machine to create packages:\n\n  * fpm, see https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm/\n  * rpmbuild (for building RPMs)\n  * gnutar / gtar (for building Debian packages)\n\nWe strongly suggest you use the same platform that you intend to install the agent on to build the packages.\nThis is because tools like `rpmbuild` and `gtar` are more available on the platforms that use those respective\npackaging systems.\n\nTo build the RPM package, execute the following command in the root directory of this repository\n\n    python build_package.py rpm\n\nTo build the Debian package, execute the following command in the root directory of this repository\n\n    python build_package.py deb\n\n### Pre-Commit Hooks\n\nThis project uses the [Black](http://black.readthedocs.io) code autoformatting tool with default\nsettings.\n\n[Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) is used to automatically run checks including Black formatting\nprior to a git commit.\n\nTo use pre-commit:\n\n- Use one of the [Installation Methods](https://pre-commit.com/#install) from the documentation.\n- Install the hooks with `pre-commit install`.\n- To manually execute the pre-commit hooks (including black), run `pre-commit run --all-files` (\n  run it on all the files) or ``pre-commit run`` (run it only on staged files).\n\nAll the pre-commit targets rely on binaries from tox virtual environment so you need to make sure\ntox virtual environment for ``lint`` target exists:\n\n```bash\ntox -elint --notest --recreate\n```\n\n#### Pre-commit Configuration\n\n- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` configures the scripts run by pre-commit\n\nTo update the Pre-commit hooks , run `pre-commit autoupdate`. This will update\n`.pre-commit-config.yaml` and will need to be committed to the repository.\n\n## Contributing\n\nIn the future, we will be pushing guidelines on how to contribute to this repository.  For now, please just\nfeel free to submit pull requests to the `master` branch and we will work with you.\n\n## Copyright, License, and Contributors Agreement\n\nCopyright 2014-2021 Scalyr, Inc.

It protects against various types of\nsupply chain attacks and provides resilience to compromise. This repository is a\n**reference implementation** written in Python. It is intended to conform to\nversion 1.0 of the [TUF\nspecification](https://theupdateframework.github.io/specification/latest/).\n\nPython-TUF provides the following APIs:\n  * [`tuf.api.metadata`](https://theupdateframework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/tuf.api.html),\n    a \"low-level\" API, designed to provide easy and safe access to TUF\n    metadata and to handle (de)serialization from/to files.\n  * [`tuf.ngclient`](https://theupdateframework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/tuf.ngclient.html),\n    a client implementation built on top of the metadata API.\n  * `tuf.repository`, a repository library also built on top of the metadata\n    API. This module is currently not considered part of python-tuf stable API.\n\nThe reference implementation strives to be a readable guide and demonstration\nfor those working on implementing TUF in their own languages, environments, or\nupdate systems.\n\n\nAbout The Update Framework\n--------------------------\nThe Update Framework (TUF) design helps developers maintain the security of a\nsoftware update system, even against attackers that compromise the repository\nor signing keys.\nTUF provides a flexible\n[specification](https://github.com/theupdateframework/specification/blob/master/tuf-spec.md)\ndefining functionality that developers can use in any software update system or\nre-implement to fit their needs.\n\nTUF is hosted by the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) as\npart of the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) (CNCF)\nand its design is [used in production](https://theupdateframework.io/adoptions/)\nby various tech companies and open source organizations. A variant of TUF\ncalled [Uptane](https://uptane.github.io/) is used to secure over-the-air\nupdates in automobiles.\n\nPlease see [TUF's website](https://theupdateframework.com/) for more information about TUF!\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n* [Introduction to TUF's Design](https://theupdateframework.io/overview/)\n* [The TUF Specification](https://theupdateframework.github.io/specification/latest/)\n* [Developer documentation](https://theupdateframework.readthedocs.io/), including\n  [API reference](\n    https://theupdateframework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/api-reference.html) and [instructions for contributors](https://theupdateframework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/CONTRIBUTING.html)\n* [Usage examples](https://github.com/theupdateframework/python-tuf/tree/develop/examples/)\n* [Governance](https://github.com/theupdateframework/python-tuf/blob/develop/docs/GOVERNANCE.md)\nand [Maintainers](https://github.com/theupdateframework/python-tuf/blob/develop/docs/MAINTAINERS.txt)\nfor the reference implementation\n* [Miscellaneous Docs](https://github.com/theupdateframework/python-tuf/tree/develop/docs)\n* [Python-TUF development blog](https://theupdateframework.github.io/python-tuf/)\n\n\nContact\n-------\nQuestions, feedback, and suggestions are welcomed on our low volume [mailing\nlist](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/theupdateframework) or\nthe [#tuf](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C8NMD3QJ3) channel on [CNCF\nSlack](https://slack.cncf.io/).\n\nWe strive to make the specification easy to implement, so if you come across\nany inconsistencies or experience any difficulty, do let us know by sending an\nemail, or by reporting an issue in the GitHub [specification\nrepo](https://github.com/theupdateframework/specification/issues).\n\nSecurity Issues and Bugs\n------------------------\n\nSee [SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md)\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nThis work is [dual-licensed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-licensing) and\ndistributed under the (1) MIT License and (2) Apache License, Version 2.0.\nPlease see [LICENSE-MIT](https://github.com/theupdateframework/python-tuf/blob/develop/LICENSE-MIT)\nand [LICENSE](https://github.com/theupdateframework/python-tuf/blob/develop/LICENSE).\n\n\nAcknowledgements\n----------------\n\nThis project is hosted by the Linux Foundation under the Cloud Native Computing\nFoundation.

                "body": "**Description of issue or feature request**:\r\nAllow TUF integrators to easily use custom metadata signing implementations instead of the currently supported securesystemslib one.\r\n\r\nAn urgent use case for this is the PEP458/Warehouse integration, where metadata must be signed with keys stored in a Hashicorp Vault and the implementation is already available.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This feature request only concerns the `tuf.api.Metadata.sign` method and not the legacy signing facilities `write` and `writeall` in repository tool.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Current behavior**:\r\n`tuf.api.Metadata.sign(key, ...)` calls `securesystemslib.keys.create_signature` with the passed sslib/json-formatted private key.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**:\r\n`tuf.api.Metadata.sign` takes an abstract signer parameter, which implements signing. A default signer may resolve to the currently used  `securesystemslib.keys.create_signature`.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Implementation considerations**:\r\n- Different signers require completely different *\"keys\"*, e.g. the currently used generic implementation requires an sslib/json-formatted private key, whereas signing implementations that don't have direct access to the key may only need a keyid (see GPG or HSM references below). As a consequence the key parameter in `Metadata.sign` should probably be encapsulated within the signer.\r\n\r\n- The abstract signer interface must strictly define the format of the returned signature for metadata interoperability.\r\n\r\n- The abstract signer interface design should also keep in mind other key-related tasks, such as signature verification, public key export to sslib metadata format, and keyid generation.\r\n\r\n- `securesystemslib.keys.create_signature` is already an abstract interface, where the json-formatted private key parameter format is generic enough to hold different key types and to choose one of many supported signing algorithms, identified by the key's `scheme` field. (see public key metadata format reference below). However, it is not suited to extend to custom implementations. A new abstract signer interface should integrate well with the existing securesystemslib infrastructure and/or aim to replace it. It should not become yet another co-existing interface and/or layer of abstraction (see public API overview reference below).\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n**Related work and references**: *(for the very ambitious reader)*\r\n\r\n- securesystemslib key overview  (to coordinate this feature request with the existing infrastructure)\r\n  - general public API overview -- [sslib#270](https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/securesystemslib/issues/270)\r\n  - generic signing interface currently used by TUF -- [sslib.keys.create_signature](https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/securesystemslib/blob/v0.18.0/securesystemslib/keys.py#L602)\r\n  - GPG signing interface -- [sslib.gpg.functions.create_signature](https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/securesystemslib/blob/v0.18.0/securesystemslib/gpg/functions.py#L38)\r\n  - WIP: HSM signing interface -- [sslib.hsm.create_signature](https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/securesystemslib/blob/2e20c56c2e65181b38511927d15a2b758f73ddec/securesystemslib/hsm.py#L358)\r\n  - general public key metadata format -- [sslib#308](https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/securesystemslib/issues/308)\r\n  -  in-memory key representation for generic signing interface -- [sslib#310](https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/securesystemslib/issues/310)\r\n  - stand-alone on-disk key format for generic signing interface -- [sslib#309](https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/securesystemslib/issues/309)\r\n\r\n- Recently added abstract filesystem interface (for design inspiration) -- https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/issues/1009\r\n\r\n- @trishankatdatadog's Hashicorp Vault interface POC (as reference for PEP458/warehouse implementation and for design inspiration) -- [VaultKey](https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/blob/495e10f346342892b3ec645b3ce488ede64dd30d/tuf/api/keys.py#L167-L429)\r\n\r\n- Abstract `pyca/cryptograhpy` key interface with sign method (for design inspiration) -- [RSAPrivateKey](https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/blob/d6535b68455767be37402ad7ce185d2e459daec8/src/cryptography/hazmat/primitives/asymmetric/rsa.py#L15-L44)\r\n\r\n- \"Historical\" external signing API feature request (has some interesting discussion and designs but targets legacy TUF codebase) -- https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/issues/864\r\n\r\n- in-toto metadata model sign methods (alternative but less flexible approach to support different signing implementations)\r\n  - implementation -- [Metadata.sign*](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto/blob/v1.0.0/in_toto/models/metadata.py#L137-L195)\r\n  - related design discussion (replace serialization/deserialization with sign/verify!) -- [sslib#272](https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/securesystemslib/issues/272#issuecomment-691056186)\r\n\r\n",

But given that our `Metadata.sign` will call the `sign` method of whichever passed `SigningKey` subclass, the interface needs to be generic for all key types and as simple as possible.\r\n\r\n> Maybe we can look the other way around and have a Key class with signature and verification functionality?\r\n\r\nYes, but I think there is an argument for separating public and private key in the model. If they were combined, we'd often have half-empty objects, e.g. on the client where only the public parts are available. And even in the signing context we only really need the private portion.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, given that public keys are included in TUF metadata their class representation should look similar to the metadata representation for recognizability and have a focus on type/schema checking and serialization tasks. Whereas we care a lot less about what the private key class looks like as long as it can be used for signing.\r\n\r\nDoes this make sense?

The important question in the interface seems to be what should `Signature` be or the return type of the `sign()` operation?\r\n\r\nJussi looked into what is the returned value of some of the possible implementors of the `Signer` interface:\r\n- `Default implementation` :  return value of keys.create_signature() is a dict of keyid and bytes\r\n-  `Gpg`: Return value is also a dict: it is used to return multiple other pieces of data as well -- it is unclear if these are actually useful to create_signature() callers or only for intermediate processing before that\r\n- `HSM`: Returns a dict like the generic keys.create_signature()\r\n- `Vault`: Vault signature is `vault:<key-version-number>:<base64-encoded-signature>` -- should be usable as bytes\r\nhttps://www.vaultproject.io/api/secret/transit#sign-data\r\nhttps://hvac.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage/secrets_engines/transit.html#sign-data\r\n\r\nSo, to summarize it seems achievable to return `bytes` instead of a custom `Signature` object which is unclear what should it be.\r\n",

                "body": "Several issues are related to this, including at least: #589, #646, #658, #736, [spec issue 19](https://github.com/theupdateframework/specification/issues/19).\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\nThe reference implementation continues to try to provide a 1-to-1 mapping of roles to keyids-the-role-should-be-signed-by-in-order-to-be-valid. This is not correct: the same role may need to be validated expecting different sets of keys, based on how the role was reached in the depth-first search while looking for target information.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line here is that **code should be rewritten in places like roledb, to avoid things like get_role_keyids(), or roleinfo['threshold'] or roleinfo['keyids'], etc.**\r\n\r\n\r\n### Detailed explanation\r\nI think this all comes from a deeper issue:\r\n\r\nPer the design of TUF, roles and delegations should never be regarded as the same thing. While in the last few years, there have emerged a few additional reasons that this separation is important (TAPs 3's multi-role delegations and TAP 5's alternative repository roots, for example), my understanding of the design history is that there was not originally an expectation of a one-to-one mapping of roles to delegations pointing to them.\r\n\r\nSo let's be pedantic:\r\n- A role is not the same thing as a delegation: a delegation is a relationship between two roles.\r\n- A delegation is a property of the delegating role, not the delegated-to role.\r\n- Therefore, for delegated roles, key IDs and thresholds are properties of a delegation, not properties of the delegated role.\r\n- You cannot simply map delegated roles to the keyids that validate them: you must map keys to delegations (that is, delegator + delegatee, if we're assuming no parallel edges in the graph (which, btw, **are we?**)).\r\n\r\nThe graph of delegations used to be guaranteed -- in the reference implementation -- to be a simple directed graph where Root is a node with an indegree of 0 and all other nodes have an indegree of 1. I.e.: No roles delegate to Root. Root delegates to Targets. Targets can delegate to various roles, but two or more roles never delegate to the same role. The design intention, however, did not guarantee maximum indegree of 1: in the design, delegations could be promiscuous: a single role can be delegated to by multiple roles.\r\n\r\nA result of this confusion is that roledb still represents roles as flat in certain ways, when it should not assume this. This flatness resulted in #589, #658, #736, probably #646, and presumably other forgotten issues.\r\n\r\nTake the function roledb.get_role_keyids() as an example: `get_role_keyids` takes only the name of a role (and a repository name), purporting to return the keys that that role should be signed by. The trouble, though, is that different roles delegating to that role can expect different keys and validate or reject role C's target information based on those different expectations.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Specification / Avoiding Future Issues\r\nThe spec itself should be a bit clearer -- [see spec issue 19](https://github.com/theupdateframework/specification/issues/19) -- about this, to help prevent these issues from arising in implementations. We may also need materials elsewhere to make the role/delegation distinction clearer. When editing the metadata formats in TAPs and the like, I've tried to make sure not to reinforce this confusion (mixing roles and delegations), and we should be mindful in that way, too.\r\n\r\nAs a sidenote, note that parallel edges would also cause this issue, not just promiscuous delegations from different origin nodes -- any role with indegree > 1 would have been an issue.",

                "body": "#### TLDR\r\nThe Mercury paper noted that a fast-forward attack is possible against a TUF repository if the timestamp and snapshot role keys (the typically online keys) are compromised, due to the way that replay attack protection works. These fast-forward attacks should be resolved by resetting the highest-seen-valid-version-number cache on the client side when a change has been made in root.json to the snapshot role after a compromise is resolved. This is not currently done in TUF.\r\n\r\n#### Replay attack background:\r\nReplay attacks are prevented by having a client refuse to accept versions of a given metadata role file smaller than the highest that they have ever seen listed for that role in a valid snapshot.json metadata file.)\r\n\r\n#### The Fast Forward Attack:\r\nIn this \"fast forward\" attack, the attacker employs compromised snapshot and timestamp keys to sign a snapshot metadata file that sets the version numbers listed in the snapshot metadata above the version number of the most recent version of the metadata files, or perhaps at the maximum version value. This results in a denial of service: clients who accept this snapshot metadata will not accept any metadata files with versions less than these arbitrarily inflated version numbers. (e.g. the malicious snapshot might list the version for root as 2048 when the most recent root version is actually 16.)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Recovery:\r\nOnce the compromised server is recovered, it is necessary to change the timestamp and snapshot keys since the old keys have been exposed. At this point, in order to allow clients who accepted the malicious snapshot.json file to update metadata again (to recover from the fast forward attack), it is necessary to reset the version numbers saved by the updater as the highest-seen-valid-version-number. (This is an attribute of the `Repository` object, `versioninfo`.)\r\n\r\nNote that this must be done *after* signature validation of a new root file, of course, so that attackers without root keys can't cause snapshot reset to enable replay attacks\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Code Delta\r\nThis change should be made to [tuf.client.updater.Updater::_update_metadata(), within the `if` block at the end of the method](https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/blob/5ba82fe9ddddc04f9ba094d4744e62733f64fae0/tuf/client/updater.py#L1403-L1405). There, it should compare canonicalized versions of `self.metadata['previous']['root']['roles']['snapshot']` and `self.metadata['current']['root']['roles']['snapshot']`. If they are not equal, we should reset the `versioninfo` cache.\r\n\r\n#### Drawbacks\r\nThis will err on the side of resetting version numbers more often than necessary, which slightly increases the vulnerability to replay attacks *only* in edge cases in which there is a change to the snapshot role entry in root.json that does _not_ make it impossible to replay old metadata. (These are edge cases, because normally, after a compromise, repository management will want to make use of the old snapshot key inadequate to validate snapshot data.) Here is an example:\r\n - There has been no compromise, but a new key is added to the snapshot role and the old key is not removed and the threshold is not increased. Client-side replay protection now drops the minimum acceptable version to 0, and replay attacks become possible using old snapshots signed with the old key.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Note on TAP 5\r\nChanges from TAP 5 will not affect this behavior, because if the changes are made as recommended above, it is not necessary for a timestamp validation to fail first.",

This seems to be a conservative hedge against Grover's algorithm causing less-than-128-bit preimage resistance for SHA-2. There is no reason to actually believe this will actually happen in the real world. In fact if we [attempt to provide a good faith estimate of what it would take to break an algorithm at the same security level as SHA-2 using Grover's algorithm today](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.04965.pdf), it is astronomically outside of what its practically possible.\r\n3) Presuming there isn't a catastrophic failure of SHA-2 as an algorithm, or major developments in applying Grover's algorithm to hash functions, there is neither any reason to presume that Grover's algorithm would even apply to SHA-256. I would put this in the same realm as \"assuming the sky doesn't turn green\" or \"assuming the ocean doesn't turn to lava\"\r\n\r\nAll that said, as someone who spends each day day-after-day working in strict FIPS 140-2 level 3 environments, I still recommend SHA-256, and see no reason in future decades why SHA-256 would not be allowed in strict FIPS 140-2 level 3 environments.\r\n\r\nSHA-512/256 (truncating SHA-512 to 256-bits) is also a very valid option, but less forward-thinking in terms of low-power devices are less likely to support SHA-512, as well as 32-bit devices cannot compute SHA-512 as efficiently in software as SHA-256.",

Some of our crypto modules previously used an object-oriented design and were refactored to use a procedural approach instead; we found the previous design lacked in readability.  Furthermore, adding support for other libraries should be a rare occurence; `pyca/cryptography` and `pycryptopp` are probably the only libraries that are going to be added in the near future.  It is ideal for these libraries to be supported directly in the code and available to others.\n\nAre you referring to [encrypt_key()](https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/blob/develop/tuf/pycrypto_keys.py#L657-L686)?  That function is approximately five lines of code if you remove the documentation; we don't mind duplicating these lines.  You may even put library-specific code in encrypt_key() if desired, `pycrypto_keys.py` happens to make the external library calls in _encrypt() to keep functions small.\n\nYou are also free to choose the names of the functions in `pycacrypto_keys.py`, as they will be directly called in `keys.py`.  For example: https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/blob/develop/tuf/keys.py#L1143-L1153.  Personally, I prefer direct and explicit calls like these, rather than indirectly through objects.  However, I do see the usability gain of an OO design for user-facing APIs.  We may even add a class for a user-facing API if we decide in the future that the crypto side should be extensible.\n\nNote: These crypto modules are heavily documented, but `ed25519_keys.py` is about 60 lines of code and `pycrypto_keys.py` 158.  `pycacrypto_keys.py` will likely be within this range.\n",

I'm don't like the idea that metadata is allowed to be compressed for the same reason that you mentioned above, possible vulnerabilities in the decompression library. I would rather not support compression if it's left in its current form. Tagging @brson since this is relevant to our email discussion.\r\n\r\nOn a similar note, if compressed images want to be served, they' have to be listed as two different targets which makes dependency management a bit annoying.\r\n\r\nThis is my proposal.\r\n\r\n1. Root and timestamp metadata are never compressed\r\n2. All other metadata may be compressed, but their entries in timestamp/snapshot need to include hashes/size of the actual image and all compressed versions\r\n3. Images may be compressed, but their entries in targets/delegations need to include hashes/size of the actual images and all compressed versions.\r\n4. Downloaded files are not streamed through the decompressor but written to disk (up to `size` for compressed file). The compressed file is validated (`hash`). They are decompressed up to `size` for the plain image. The decompressed file is validated (`hash`). Then it's passed on to the application.\r\n\r\nThe size for the decompressed data must be known to prevent the case of tar-bombs filling the disk on decompression.\r\n\r\nFor example, it would look something like this:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"some/target\": {\r\n  \"size\": 1234,\r\n  \"hashes\": {\r\n    \"sha256\": \"abcdef01234\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"compressed\": {\r\n     \"tar.gz\": {\r\n       \"size\": 456,\r\n       \"hashes\": {\r\n          \"sha256\": \"1234dcba\"\r\n       }\r\n   }  \r\n}\r\n```",

A bogus clock becomes a non-issue with version numbers; we now at least protect the previous 'ts' field. \n\n(3) Delegated targets metadata have not expired (we only check for the top-level roles).\n\n_refresh_targets_metadata() is called when updating delegated roles.

                "body": "**Description of issue or feature request**:\r\nAllow TUF integrators to easily use custom metadata signing implementations instead of the currently supported securesystemslib one.\r\n\r\nAn urgent use case for this is the PEP458/Warehouse integration, where metadata must be signed with keys stored in a Hashicorp Vault and the implementation is already available.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This feature request only concerns the `tuf.api.Metadata.sign` method and not the legacy signing facilities `write` and `writeall` in repository tool.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Current behavior**:\r\n`tuf.api.Metadata.sign(key, ...)` calls `securesystemslib.keys.create_signature` with the passed sslib/json-formatted private key.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**:\r\n`tuf.api.Metadata.sign` takes an abstract signer parameter, which implements signing. A default signer may resolve to the currently used  `securesystemslib.keys.create_signature`.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Implementation considerations**:\r\n- Different signers require completely different *\"keys\"*, e.g. the currently used generic implementation requires an sslib/json-formatted private key, whereas signing implementations that don't have direct access to the key may only need a keyid (see GPG or HSM references below). As a consequence the key parameter in `Metadata.sign` should probably be encapsulated within the signer.\r\n\r\n- The abstract signer interface must strictly define the format of the returned signature for metadata interoperability.\r\n\r\n- The abstract signer interface design should also keep in mind other key-related tasks, such as signature verification, public key export to sslib metadata format, and keyid generation.\r\n\r\n- `securesystemslib.keys.create_signature` is already an abstract interface, where the json-formatted private key parameter format is generic enough to hold different key types and to choose one of many supported signing algorithms, identified by the key's `scheme` field. (see public key metadata format reference below). However, it is not suited to extend to custom implementations. A new abstract signer interface should integrate well with the existing securesystemslib infrastructure and/or aim to replace it. It should not become yet another co-existing interface and/or layer of abstraction (see public API overview reference below).\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n**Related work and references**: *(for the very ambitious reader)*\r\n\r\n- securesystemslib key overview  (to coordinate this feature request with the existing infrastructure)\r\n  - general public API overview -- [sslib#270](https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/securesystemslib/issues/270)\r\n  - generic signing interface currently used by TUF -- [sslib.keys.create_signature](https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/securesystemslib/blob/v0.18.0/securesystemslib/keys.py#L602)\r\n  - GPG signing interface -- [sslib.gpg.functions.create_signature](https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/securesystemslib/blob/v0.18.0/securesystemslib/gpg/functions.py#L38)\r\n  - WIP: HSM signing interface -- [sslib.hsm.create_signature](https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/securesystemslib/blob/2e20c56c2e65181b38511927d15a2b758f73ddec/securesystemslib/hsm.py#L358)\r\n  - general public key metadata format -- [sslib#308](https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/securesystemslib/issues/308)\r\n  -  in-memory key representation for generic signing interface -- [sslib#310](https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/securesystemslib/issues/310)\r\n  - stand-alone on-disk key format for generic signing interface -- [sslib#309](https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/securesystemslib/issues/309)\r\n\r\n- Recently added abstract filesystem interface (for design inspiration) -- https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/issues/1009\r\n\r\n- @trishankatdatadog's Hashicorp Vault interface POC (as reference for PEP458/warehouse implementation and for design inspiration) -- [VaultKey](https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/blob/495e10f346342892b3ec645b3ce488ede64dd30d/tuf/api/keys.py#L167-L429)\r\n\r\n- Abstract `pyca/cryptograhpy` key interface with sign method (for design inspiration) -- [RSAPrivateKey](https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/blob/d6535b68455767be37402ad7ce185d2e459daec8/src/cryptography/hazmat/primitives/asymmetric/rsa.py#L15-L44)\r\n\r\n- \"Historical\" external signing API feature request (has some interesting discussion and designs but targets legacy TUF codebase) -- https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/issues/864\r\n\r\n- in-toto metadata model sign methods (alternative but less flexible approach to support different signing implementations)\r\n  - implementation -- [Metadata.sign*](https://github.com/in-toto/in-toto/blob/v1.0.0/in_toto/models/metadata.py#L137-L195)\r\n  - related design discussion (replace serialization/deserialization with sign/verify!) -- [sslib#272](https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/securesystemslib/issues/272#issuecomment-691056186)\r\n\r\n",

But given that our `Metadata.sign` will call the `sign` method of whichever passed `SigningKey` subclass, the interface needs to be generic for all key types and as simple as possible.\r\n\r\n> Maybe we can look the other way around and have a Key class with signature and verification functionality?\r\n\r\nYes, but I think there is an argument for separating public and private key in the model. If they were combined, we'd often have half-empty objects, e.g. on the client where only the public parts are available. And even in the signing context we only really need the private portion.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, given that public keys are included in TUF metadata their class representation should look similar to the metadata representation for recognizability and have a focus on type/schema checking and serialization tasks. Whereas we care a lot less about what the private key class looks like as long as it can be used for signing.\r\n\r\nDoes this make sense?

The interface @lukpueh proposed is fairly clear and easy to implement.\r\n2. The important question in the interface seems to be what should `Signature` be or the return type of the `sign()` operation?\r\n\r\nJussi looked into what is the returned value of some of the possible implementors of the `Signer` interface:\r\n- `Default implementation` :  return value of keys.create_signature() is a dict of keyid and bytes\r\n-  `Gpg`: Return value is also a dict: it is used to return multiple other pieces of data as well -- it is unclear if these are actually useful to create_signature() callers or only for intermediate processing before that\r\n- `HSM`: Returns a dict like the generic keys.create_signature()\r\n- `Vault`: Vault signature is `vault:<key-version-number>:<base64-encoded-signature>` -- should be usable as bytes\r\nhttps://www.vaultproject.io/api/secret/transit#sign-data\r\nhttps://hvac.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage/secrets_engines/transit.html#sign-data\r\n\r\nSo, to summarize it seems achievable to return `bytes` instead of a custom `Signature` object which is unclear what should it be.\r\n",

But then every `SignerKey` must also expose a keyid. Because the caller is likely to store the signature bytes together with a keyid, otherwise the signature can't be mapped to a public key for later verification.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass Metadata:\r\n  ...\r\n  def sign(self, signer):\r\n    # NOTE: Let's assume signatures are still in the old/current dictionary format\r\n    self.signatures.append({\r\n        \"keyid\": signer.keyid,\r\n        \"sig\": signer.sign(self.signed.to_canonical_bytes())\r\n      })\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think your proposal makes the `SignerKey.sign` interface a bit cleaner, but the overall `SignerKey` class a bit less blackboxy.\r\n\r\n> Gpg: Return value is also a dict: it is used to return multiple other pieces of data as well -- it is unclear if these are actually useful to create_signature() callers or only for intermediate processing before that\r\n\r\nYeah, unfortunately these \"other_headers\" are required for verification.

                "body": "Several issues are related to this, including at least: #589, #646, #658, #736, [spec issue 19](https://github.com/theupdateframework/specification/issues/19).\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\nThe reference implementation continues to try to provide a 1-to-1 mapping of roles to keyids-the-role-should-be-signed-by-in-order-to-be-valid. This is not correct: the same role may need to be validated expecting different sets of keys, based on how the role was reached in the depth-first search while looking for target information.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line here is that **code should be rewritten in places like roledb, to avoid things like get_role_keyids(), or roleinfo['threshold'] or roleinfo['keyids'], etc.**\r\n\r\n\r\n### Detailed explanation\r\nI think this all comes from a deeper issue:\r\n\r\nPer the design of TUF, roles and delegations should never be regarded as the same thing. While in the last few years, there have emerged a few additional reasons that this separation is important (TAPs 3's multi-role delegations and TAP 5's alternative repository roots, for example), my understanding of the design history is that there was not originally an expectation of a one-to-one mapping of roles to delegations pointing to them.\r\n\r\nSo let's be pedantic:\r\n- A role is not the same thing as a delegation: a delegation is a relationship between two roles.\r\n- A delegation is a property of the delegating role, not the delegated-to role.\r\n- Therefore, for delegated roles, key IDs and thresholds are properties of a delegation, not properties of the delegated role.\r\n- You cannot simply map delegated roles to the keyids that validate them: you must map keys to delegations (that is, delegator + delegatee, if we're assuming no parallel edges in the graph (which, btw, **are we?**)).\r\n\r\nThe graph of delegations used to be guaranteed -- in the reference implementation -- to be a simple directed graph where Root is a node with an indegree of 0 and all other nodes have an indegree of 1. I.e.: No roles delegate to Root. Root delegates to Targets. Targets can delegate to various roles, but two or more roles never delegate to the same role. The design intention, however, did not guarantee maximum indegree of 1: in the design, delegations could be promiscuous: a single role can be delegated to by multiple roles.\r\n\r\nA result of this confusion is that roledb still represents roles as flat in certain ways, when it should not assume this. This flatness resulted in #589, #658, #736, probably #646, and presumably other forgotten issues.\r\n\r\nTake the function roledb.get_role_keyids() as an example: `get_role_keyids` takes only the name of a role (and a repository name), purporting to return the keys that that role should be signed by. The trouble, though, is that different roles delegating to that role can expect different keys and validate or reject role C's target information based on those different expectations.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Specification / Avoiding Future Issues\r\nThe spec itself should be a bit clearer -- [see spec issue 19](https://github.com/theupdateframework/specification/issues/19) -- about this, to help prevent these issues from arising in implementations. We may also need materials elsewhere to make the role/delegation distinction clearer. When editing the metadata formats in TAPs and the like, I've tried to make sure not to reinforce this confusion (mixing roles and delegations), and we should be mindful in that way, too.\r\n\r\nAs a sidenote, note that parallel edges would also cause this issue, not just promiscuous delegations from different origin nodes -- any role with indegree > 1 would have been an issue.",

Arusekk is the one that is currently the most excited to fix vulnerabilities.\nOr create a CTF task!  Prove a point the good old hacker way!\n",

Written in Python, it is designed for rapid prototyping and development, and intended to make exploit writing as simple as possible.\n\n```python\nfrom pwn import *\ncontext(arch = 'i386', os = 'linux')\n\nr = remote('exploitme.example.com', 31337)\n# EXPLOIT CODE GOES HERE\nr.send(asm(shellcraft.sh()))\nr.interactive()\n```\n\n# Documentation\n\nOur documentation is available at [docs.pwntools.com](https://docs.pwntools.com/)\n\nA series of tutorials is also [available online](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools-tutorial#readme)\n\nTo get you started, we've provided some example solutions for past CTF challenges in our [write-ups repository](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools-write-ups).\n\n# Installation\n\nPwntools is best supported on 64-bit Ubuntu LTS releases (18.04, 20.04, 22.04, and 24.04).  Most functionality should work on any Posix-like distribution (Debian, Arch, FreeBSD, OSX, etc.).  \n\nPython3 is suggested, but Pwntools still works with Python 2.7.  Most of the functionality of pwntools is self-contained and Python-only.  You should be able to get running quickly with\n\n```sh\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip python3-dev git libssl-dev libffi-dev build-essential\npython3 -m pip install --upgrade pip\npython3 -m pip install --upgrade pwntools\n```\n\n\nHowever, some of the features (assembling/disassembling foreign architectures) require non-Python dependencies.  For more information, see the [complete installation instructions here](https://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/install.html).\n\n\n# Contribution\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n# Contact and Community\nIf you have any questions not worthy of a [bug report](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools/issues), join the Discord server at https://discord.gg/96VA2zvjCB\n",

Seriously though:  \nIt has the [most common features](#general-commands) of many chatbots (!flip, !8, stopwatch, etc.), **custom commands** (inspired by Twitch's [Nightbot](https://www.nightbot.tv/)), memes.  \nIt features some games such as **Trivia**, rock paper scissors, [users can earn and play with credits](#economy-commands) in the slot machine.  \n[The audio part is quite fleshed out](#audio-commands). Users can **stream youtube videos**, create **playlists** that everyone will be able to play and control (previous/next song, pause/resume, shuffle...).  \n**MP3 and flac files can also be streamed** (see [FAQ](#faq) for details on local playlists)  \n**Twitch's online notifications**: Red will notify the channels you want whenever you favorite Twitch streamers are online.  \nAs for the moderation tools, it includes a **powerful message filter with regular expression capabilities** and **mass messages cleanup**.  \n[I'm planning to expand all this much more](#todo-list).  \nSee the [command list](#general-commands) for an even better idea of what this bot can do.\n\n### I don't even know what I'm looking at. How do I install this?\nDo not panic.

Were you drunk when you coded this?  \n\nYou're probably missing something.  \nFeel free to join [my server](https://discord.gg/0k4npTwMvTpv9wrh) and head to #support to get some help! Oh, and my drinking habits are none of your business.  \n\n>Does this bot work on multiple servers?  \n\nSure it does. Should you do it? Maybe. The permissions system is not that great at the moment but if you trust the people running the server it's ok. It's not advisable to send the bot in random servers at the moment.   \nCustom commands only work in the server they were created in. Same for the message filter. This is by design. Also, remember that the bot can only be in one voice channel at once.\n\n>Will you implement [feature]?  \n\nSuggestions are always very welcome.\n\n>How do local playlists work?\n\nMake as many folders as you want inside the localtracks folder. Names must be without spaces. Every folder counts as a different playlist. Every playlist can contain mp3 and flac files. Users can stream them by doing !local [playlist_name] and see the full list\nwith !local or !locallist. They can also add tracks to their favorites.\n\n>What's download mode?\n\nEverytime you play the audio of a youtube video with download mode on the audio will be first downloaded and stored into the \"cache\" folder. It is recommended that you use this mode to avoid streaming problems. This is the default mode, you can switch between modes with !downloadmode.\n\n>Why is this bot called Red and the admin role \"Transistor\"? What's the meaning of !sing?\n\nThey're all references to [Transistor](https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/transistor/), a videogame by Supergiant Games.\n\n### TODO List\n- [x] [Start rewriting Red](https://github.com/Twentysix26/Red-DiscordBot/tree/develop)\n- [ ]  ~~Bundle some malware and slowly build up a botnet for world domination~~\n",

We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem.\n\nPlease report security issues using https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/security/advisories/new\n\nPlease refer to the following page for our responsible disclosure policy, reward guidelines, and those things that should not be reported:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/whitehat\n\n\n## Using Pytorch Securely\n**Pytorch models are programs**, so treat its security seriously -- running untrusted models is equivalent to running untrusted code. In general we recommend that model weights and the python code for the model are distributed independently. That said, be careful about where you get the python code from and who wrote it (preferentially check for a provenance or checksums, do not run any pip installed package).\n\n### Untrusted models\nBe careful when running untrusted models. This classification includes models created by unknown developers or utilizing data obtained from unknown sources[^data-poisoning-sources].\n\n**Prefer to execute untrusted models within a secure, isolated environment such as a sandbox** (e.g., containers, virtual machines). This helps protect your system from potentially malicious code. You can find further details and instructions in [this page](https://developers.google.com/code-sandboxing).\n\n**Be mindful of risky model formats**. Give preference to share and load weights with the appropriate format for your use case. [safetensors](https://huggingface.co/docs/safetensors/en/index) gives the most safety but is the most restricted in what it supports. [`torch.load`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.load.html#torch.load) with `weights_only=True` is also secure to our knowledge even though it offers significantly larger surface of attack. Loading un-trusted checkpoint with `weights_only=False` MUST never be done.\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The trustworthiness of a model is not binary. You must always determine the proper level of caution depending on the specific model and how it matches your use case and risk tolerance.\n\n[^data-poisoning-sources]: To understand risks of utilization of data from unknown sources, read the following Cornell papers on Data poisoning:\n    https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04748\n    https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05566\n\n### Untrusted inputs during training and prediction\n\nIf you plan to open your model to untrusted inputs, be aware that inputs can also be used as vectors by malicious agents. To minimize risks, make sure to give your model only the permissions strictly required, and keep your libraries updated with the latest security patches.\n\nIf applicable, prepare your model against bad inputs and prompt injections. Some recommendations:\n- Pre-analysis: check how the model performs by default when exposed to prompt injection (e.g. using fuzzing for prompt injection).\n- Input Sanitation: Before feeding data to the model, sanitize inputs rigorously. This involves techniques such as:\n    - Validation: Enforce strict rules on allowed characters and data types.\n    - Filtering: Remove potentially malicious scripts or code fragments.\n    - Encoding: Convert special characters into safe representations.\n    - Verification: Run tooling that identifies potential script injections (e.g. [models that detect prompt injection attempts](https://python.langchain.com/docs/guides/safety/hugging_face_prompt_injection)).\n\n### Data privacy\n\n**Take special security measures if your model if you train models with sensitive data**. Prioritize [sandboxing](https://developers.google.com/code-sandboxing) your models and:\n- Do not feed sensitive data to untrusted model (even if runs in a sandboxed environment)\n- If you consider publishing a model that was partially trained with sensitive data, be aware that data can potentially be recovered from the trained weights (especially if model overfits).\n\n### Using distributed features\n\nPyTorch can be used for distributed computing, and as such there is a `torch.distributed` package. PyTorch Distributed features are intended for internal communication only. They are not built for use in untrusted environments or networks.\n\nFor performance reasons, none of the PyTorch Distributed primitives (including c10d, RPC, and TCPStore) include any authorization protocol and will send messages unencrypted. They accept connections from anywhere, and execute the workload sent without performing any checks. Therefore, if you run a PyTorch Distributed program on your network, anybody with access to the network can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running PyTorch.\n\n## CI/CD security principles\n_Audience_: Contributors and reviewers, especially if modifying the workflow files/build system.\n\nPyTorch CI/CD security philosophy is based on finding a balance between open and transparent CI pipelines while keeping the environment efficient and safe.\n\nPyTorch testing requirements are complex, and a large part of the code base can only be tested on specialized powerful hardware, such as GPU, making it a lucrative target for resource misuse. To prevent this, we require workflow run approval for PRs from non-member contributors. To keep the volume of those approvals relatively low, we easily extend write permissions to the repository to regular contributors.\n\nMore widespread write access to the repo presents challenges when it comes to reviewing changes, merging code into trunk, and creating releases. [Protected branches](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches) are used to restrict the ability to merge to the trunk/release branches only to the repository administrators and merge bot. The merge bot is responsible for mechanistically merging the change and validating reviews against the path-based rules defined in [merge_rules.yml](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/.github/merge_rules.yaml). Once a PR has been reviewed by person(s) mentioned in these rules, leaving a `@pytorchbot merge` comment on the PR will initiate the merge process. To protect merge bot credentials from leaking, merge actions must be executed only on ephemeral runners (see definition below) using a specialized deployment environment.\n\nTo speed up the CI system, build steps of the workflow rely on the distributed caching mechanism backed by [sccache](https://github.com/mozilla/sccache), making them susceptible to cache corruption compromises. For that reason binary artifacts generated during CI should not be executed in an environment that contains an access to any sensitive/non-public information and should not be published for use by general audience. One should not have any expectation about the lifetime of those artifacts, although in practice they likely remain accessible for about two weeks after the PR has been closed.\n\nTo speed up CI system setup, PyTorch relies heavily on Docker to pre-build and pre-install the dependencies. To prevent a potentially malicious PR from altering ones that were published in the past, ECR has been configured to use immutable tags.\n\nTo improve runner availability and more efficient resource utilization, some of the CI runners are non-ephemeral, i.e., workflow steps from completely unrelated PRs could be scheduled sequentially on the same runner, making them susceptible to reverse shell attacks. For that reason, PyTorch does not rely on the repository secrets mechanism, as these can easily be compromised in such attacks.\n\n### Release pipelines security\n\nTo ensure safe binary releases, PyTorch release pipelines are built on the following principles:\n - All binary builds/upload jobs must be run on ephemeral runners, i.e., on a machine that is allocated from the cloud to do the build and released back to the cloud after the build is finished. This protects those builds from interference from external actors, who potentially can get reverse shell access to a non-ephemeral runner and wait there for a binary build.\n - All binary builds are cold-start builds, i.e., distributed caching/incremental builds are not permitted. This renders builds much slower than incremental CI builds but isolates them from potential compromises of the intermediate artifacts caching systems.\n - All upload jobs are executed in a [deployment environments](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment) that are restricted to protected branches\n - Security credentials needed to upload binaries to PyPI/conda or stable indexes `download.pytorch.org/whl` are never uploaded to repo secrets storage/environment. This requires an extra manual step to publish the release but ensures that access to those would not be compromised by deliberate/accidental leaks of secrets stored in the cloud.\n - No binary artifacts should be published to GitHub releases pages, as these are overwritable by anyone with write permission to the repo.\n",

Useful for data loading and Hogwild training |\n| [**torch.utils**](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html) | DataLoader and other utility functions for convenience |\n\nUsually, PyTorch is used either as:\n\n- A replacement for NumPy to use the power of GPUs.\n- A deep learning research platform that provides maximum flexibility and speed.\n\nElaborating Further:\n\n### A GPU-Ready Tensor Library\n\nIf you use NumPy, then you have used Tensors (a.k.a. ndarray).\n\n![Tensor illustration](./docs/source/_static/img/tensor_illustration.png)\n\nPyTorch provides Tensors that can live either on the CPU or the GPU and accelerates the\ncomputation by a huge amount.\n\nWe provide a wide variety of tensor routines to accelerate and fit your scientific computation needs\nsuch as slicing, indexing, mathematical operations, linear algebra, reductions.\nAnd they are fast!\n\n### Dynamic Neural Networks: Tape-Based Autograd\n\nPyTorch has a unique way of building neural networks: using and replaying a tape recorder.\n\nMost frameworks such as TensorFlow, Theano, Caffe, and CNTK have a static view of the world.\nOne has to build a neural network and reuse the same structure again and again.\nChanging the way the network behaves means that one has to start from scratch.\n\nWith PyTorch, we use a technique called reverse-mode auto-differentiation, which allows you to\nchange the way your network behaves arbitrarily with zero lag or overhead. Our inspiration comes\nfrom several research papers on this topic, as well as current and past work such as\n[torch-autograd](https://github.com/twitter/torch-autograd),\n[autograd](https://github.com/HIPS/autograd),\n[Chainer](https://chainer.org), etc.\n\nWhile this technique is not unique to PyTorch, it's one of the fastest implementations of it to date.\nYou get the best of speed and flexibility for your crazy research.\n\n![Dynamic graph](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/raw/main/docs/source/_static/img/dynamic_graph.gif)\n\n### Python First\n\nPyTorch is not a Python binding into a monolithic C++ framework.\nIt is built to be deeply integrated into Python.\nYou can use it naturally like you would use [NumPy](https://www.numpy.org/) / [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) / [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org) etc.\nYou can write your new neural network layers in Python itself, using your favorite libraries\nand use packages such as [Cython](https://cython.org/) and [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/).\nOur goal is to not reinvent the wheel where appropriate.\n\n### Imperative Experiences\n\nPyTorch is designed to be intuitive, linear in thought, and easy to use.\nWhen you execute a line of code, it gets executed. There isn't an asynchronous view of the world.\nWhen you drop into a debugger or receive error messages and stack traces, understanding them is straightforward.\nThe stack trace points to exactly where your code was defined.\nWe hope you never spend hours debugging your code because of bad stack traces or asynchronous and opaque execution engines.\n\n### Fast and Lean\n\nPyTorch has minimal framework overhead. We integrate acceleration libraries\nsuch as [Intel MKL](https://software.intel.com/mkl) and NVIDIA ([cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn), [NCCL](https://developer.nvidia.com/nccl)) to maximize speed.\nAt the core, its CPU and GPU Tensor and neural network backends\nare mature and have been tested for years.\n\nHence, PyTorch is quite fast — whether you run small or large neural networks.\n\nThe memory usage in PyTorch is extremely efficient compared to Torch or some of the alternatives.\nWe've written custom memory allocators for the GPU to make sure that\nyour deep learning models are maximally memory efficient.\nThis enables you to train bigger deep learning models than before.\n\n### Extensions Without Pain\n\nWriting new neural network modules, or interfacing with PyTorch's Tensor API was designed to be straightforward\nand with minimal abstractions.\n\nYou can write new neural network layers in Python using the torch API\n[or your favorite NumPy-based libraries such as SciPy](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/numpy_extensions_tutorial.html).\n\nIf you want to write your layers in C/C++, we provide a convenient extension API that is efficient and with minimal boilerplate.\nNo wrapper code needs to be written. You can see [a tutorial here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/cpp_extension.html) and [an example here](https://github.com/pytorch/extension-cpp).\n\n\n## Installation\n\n### Binaries\nCommands to install binaries via Conda or pip wheels are on our website: [https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)\n\n\n#### NVIDIA Jetson Platforms\n\nPython wheels for NVIDIA's Jetson Nano, Jetson TX1/TX2, Jetson Xavier NX/AGX, and Jetson AGX Orin are provided [here](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/pytorch-for-jetson-version-1-10-now-available/72048) and the L4T container is published [here](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/l4t-pytorch)\n\nThey require JetPack 4.2 and above, and [@dusty-nv](https://github.com/dusty-nv) and [@ptrblck](https://github.com/ptrblck) are maintaining them.\n\n\n### From Source\n\n#### Prerequisites\nIf you are installing from source, you will need:\n- Python 3.9 or later\n- A compiler that fully supports C++17, such as clang or gcc (gcc 9.4.0 or newer is required, on Linux)\n- Visual Studio or Visual Studio Build Tool on Windows\n\n\\* PyTorch CI uses Visual C++ BuildTools, which come with Visual Studio Enterprise,\nProfessional, or Community Editions. You can also install the build tools from\nhttps://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/. The build tools *do not*\ncome with Visual Studio Code by default.\n\n\\* We highly recommend installing an [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) environment. You will get a high-quality BLAS library (MKL) and you get controlled dependency versions regardless of your Linux distro.\n\nAn example of environment setup is shown below:\n\n* Linux:\n\n```bash\n$ source <CONDA_INSTALL_DIR>/bin/activate\n$ conda create -y -n <CONDA_NAME>\n$ conda activate <CONDA_NAME>\n```\n\n* Windows:\n\n```bash\n$ source <CONDA_INSTALL_DIR>\\Scripts\\activate.bat\n$ conda create -y -n <CONDA_NAME>\n$ conda activate <CONDA_NAME>\n$ call \"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\<VERSION>\\Community\\VC\\Auxiliary\\Build\\vcvarsall.bat\" x64\n```\n\n##### NVIDIA CUDA Support\nIf you want to compile with CUDA support, [select a supported version of CUDA from our support matrix](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/), then install the following:\n- [NVIDIA CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)\n- [NVIDIA cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) v8.5 or above\n- [Compiler](https://gist.github.com/ax3l/9489132) compatible with CUDA\n\nNote: You could refer to the [cuDNN Support Matrix](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/cudnn/reference/support-matrix.html) for cuDNN versions with the various supported CUDA, CUDA driver and NVIDIA hardware\n\nIf you want to disable CUDA support, export the environment variable `USE_CUDA=0`.\nOther potentially useful environment variables may be found in `setup.py`.\n\nIf you are building for NVIDIA's Jetson platforms (Jetson Nano, TX1, TX2, AGX Xavier), Instructions to install PyTorch for Jetson Nano are [available here](https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/1049071/jetson-nano/pytorch-for-jetson-nano/)\n\n##### AMD ROCm Support\nIf you want to compile with ROCm support, install\n- [AMD ROCm](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/deploy/linux/quick_start.html) 4.0 and above installation\n- ROCm is currently supported only for Linux systems.\n\nBy default the build system expects ROCm to be installed in `/opt/rocm`. If ROCm is installed in a different directory, the `ROCM_PATH` environment variable must be set to the ROCm installation directory. The build system automatically detects the AMD GPU architecture. Optionally, the AMD GPU architecture can be explicitly set with the `PYTORCH_ROCM_ARCH` environment variable [AMD GPU architecture](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/reference/system-requirements.html#supported-gpus)\n\nIf you want to disable ROCm support, export the environment variable `USE_ROCM=0`.\nOther potentially useful environment variables may be found in `setup.py`.\n\n##### Intel GPU Support\nIf you want to compile with Intel GPU support, follow these\n- [PyTorch Prerequisites for Intel GPUs](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/tool/pytorch-prerequisites-for-intel-gpus.html) instructions.\n- Intel GPU is supported for Linux and Windows.\n\nIf you want to disable Intel GPU support, export the environment variable `USE_XPU=0`.\nOther potentially useful environment variables may be found in `setup.py`.\n\n#### Get the PyTorch Source\n```bash\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch\ncd pytorch\n# if you are updating an existing checkout\ngit submodule sync\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\n```\n\n#### Install Dependencies\n\n**Common**\n\n```bash\nconda install cmake ninja\n# Run this command on native Windows\nconda install rust\n# Run this command from the PyTorch directory after cloning the source code using the “Get the PyTorch Source“ section below\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n**On Linux**\n\n```bash\npip install mkl-static mkl-include\n# CUDA only: Add LAPACK support for the GPU if needed\nconda install -c pytorch magma-cuda121  # or the magma-cuda* that matches your CUDA version from https://anaconda.org/pytorch/repo\n\n# (optional) If using torch.compile with inductor/triton, install the matching version of triton\n# Run from the pytorch directory after cloning\n# For Intel GPU support, please explicitly `export USE_XPU=1` before running command.\nmake triton\n```\n\n**On MacOS**\n\n```bash\n# Add this package on intel x86 processor machines only\npip install mkl-static mkl-include\n# Add these packages if torch.distributed is needed\nconda install pkg-config libuv\n```\n\n**On Windows**\n\n```bash\npip install mkl-static mkl-include\n# Add these packages if torch.distributed is needed.\n# Distributed package support on Windows is a prototype feature and is subject to changes.\nconda install -c conda-forge libuv=1.39\n```\n\n#### Install PyTorch\n**On Linux**\n\nIf you would like to compile PyTorch with [new C++ ABI](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/using_dual_abi.html) enabled, then first run this command:\n```bash\nexport _GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=1\n```\n\nPlease **note** that starting from PyTorch 2.5, the PyTorch build with XPU supports both new and old C++ ABIs. Previously, XPU only supported the new C++ ABI. If you want to compile with Intel GPU support, please follow [Intel GPU Support](#intel-gpu-support).\n\nIf you're compiling for AMD ROCm then first run this command:\n```bash\n# Only run this if you're compiling for ROCm\npython tools/amd_build/build_amd.py\n```\n\nInstall PyTorch\n```bash\nexport CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=\"${CONDA_PREFIX:-'$(dirname $(which conda))/../'}:${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}\"\npython setup.py develop\n```\n\n**On macOS**\n\n```bash\npython3 setup.py develop\n```\n\n**On Windows**\n\nIf you want to build legacy python code, please refer to [Building on legacy code and CUDA](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#building-on-legacy-code-and-cuda)\n\n**CPU-only builds**\n\nIn this mode PyTorch computations will run on your CPU, not your GPU\n\n```cmd\npython setup.py develop\n```\n\nNote on OpenMP: The desired OpenMP implementation is Intel OpenMP (iomp). In order to link against iomp, you'll need to manually download the library and set up the building environment by tweaking `CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH` and `LIB`. The instruction [here](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/docs/source/notes/windows.rst#building-from-source) is an example for setting up both MKL and Intel OpenMP. Without these configurations for CMake, Microsoft Visual C OpenMP runtime (vcomp) will be used.\n\n**CUDA based build**\n\nIn this mode PyTorch computations will leverage your GPU via CUDA for faster number crunching\n\n[NVTX](https://docs.nvidia.com/gameworks/content/gameworkslibrary/nvtx/nvidia_tools_extension_library_nvtx.htm) is needed to build Pytorch with CUDA.\nNVTX is a part of CUDA distributive, where it is called \"Nsight Compute\". To install it onto an already installed CUDA run CUDA installation once again and check the corresponding checkbox.\nMake sure that CUDA with Nsight Compute is installed after Visual Studio.\n\nCurrently, VS 2017 / 2019, and Ninja are supported as the generator of CMake. If `ninja.exe` is detected in `PATH`, then Ninja will be used as the default generator, otherwise, it will use VS 2017 / 2019.\n<br/> If Ninja is selected as the generator, the latest MSVC will get selected as the underlying toolchain.\n\nAdditional libraries such as\n[Magma](https://developer.nvidia.com/magma), [oneDNN, a.k.a. MKLDNN or DNNL](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneDNN), and [Sccache](https://github.com/mozilla/sccache) are often needed. Please refer to the [installation-helper](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/tree/main/.ci/pytorch/win-test-helpers/installation-helpers) to install them.\n\nYou can refer to the [build_pytorch.bat](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/.ci/pytorch/win-test-helpers/build_pytorch.bat) script for some other environment variables configurations\n\n\n```cmd\ncmd\n\n:: Set the environment variables after you have downloaded and unzipped the mkl package,\n:: else CMake would throw an error as `Could NOT find OpenMP`.\nset CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH={Your directory}\\mkl\\include\nset LIB={Your directory}\\mkl\\lib;%LIB%\n\n:: Read the content in the previous section carefully before you proceed.\n:: [Optional] If you want to override the underlying toolset used by Ninja and Visual Studio with CUDA, please run the following script block.\n:: \"Visual Studio 2019 Developer Command Prompt\" will be run automatically.\n:: Make sure you have CMake >= 3.12 before you do this when you use the Visual Studio generator.\nset CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET_VERSION=14.27\nset DISTUTILS_USE_SDK=1\nfor /f \"usebackq tokens=*\" %i in (`\"%ProgramFiles(x86)%\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\Installer\\vswhere.exe\" -version [15^,17^) -products * -latest -property installationPath`) do call \"%i\\VC\\Auxiliary\\Build\\vcvarsall.bat\" x64 -vcvars_ver=%CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET_VERSION%\n\n:: [Optional] If you want to override the CUDA host compiler\nset CUDAHOSTCXX=C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\Community\\VC\\Tools\\MSVC\\14.27.29110\\bin\\HostX64\\x64\\cl.exe\n\npython setup.py develop\n\n```\n\n##### Adjust Build Options (Optional)\n\nYou can adjust the configuration of cmake variables optionally (without building first), by doing\nthe following. For example, adjusting the pre-detected directories for CuDNN or BLAS can be done\nwith such a step.\n\nOn Linux\n```bash\nexport CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=\"${CONDA_PREFIX:-'$(dirname $(which conda))/../'}:${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}\"\npython setup.py build --cmake-only\nccmake build  # or cmake-gui build\n```\n\nOn macOS\n```bash\nexport CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=\"${CONDA_PREFIX:-'$(dirname $(which conda))/../'}:${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}\"\nMACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.9 CC=clang CXX=clang++ python setup.py build --cmake-only\nccmake build  # or cmake-gui build\n```\n\n### Docker Image\n\n#### Using pre-built images\n\nYou can also pull a pre-built docker image from Docker Hub and run with docker v19.03+\n\n```bash\ndocker run --gpus all --rm -ti --ipc=host pytorch/pytorch:latest\n```\n\nPlease note that PyTorch uses shared memory to share data between processes, so if torch multiprocessing is used (e.g.\nfor multithreaded data loaders) the default shared memory segment size that container runs with is not enough, and you\nshould increase shared memory size either with `--ipc=host` or `--shm-size` command line options to `nvidia-docker run`.\n\n#### Building the image yourself\n\n**NOTE:** Must be built with a docker version > 18.06\n\nThe `Dockerfile` is supplied to build images with CUDA 11.1 support and cuDNN v8.\nYou can pass `PYTHON_VERSION=x.y` make variable to specify which Python version is to be used by Miniconda, or leave it\nunset to use the default.\n\n```bash\nmake -f docker.Makefile\n# images are tagged as docker.io/${your_docker_username}/pytorch\n```\n\nYou can also pass the `CMAKE_VARS=\"...\"` environment variable to specify additional CMake variables to be passed to CMake during the build.\nSee [setup.py](./setup.py) for the list of available variables.\n\n```bash\nmake -f docker.Makefile\n```\n\n### Building the Documentation\n\nTo build documentation in various formats, you will need [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org) and the\nreadthedocs theme.\n\n```bash\ncd docs/\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\nYou can then build the documentation by running `make <format>` from the\n`docs/` folder. Run `make` to get a list of all available output formats.\n\nIf you get a katex error run `npm install katex`.  If it persists, try\n`npm install -g katex`\n\n> Note: if you installed `nodejs` with a different package manager (e.g.,\n`conda`) then `npm` will probably install a version of `katex` that is not\ncompatible with your version of `nodejs` and doc builds will fail.\nA combination of versions that is known to work is `node@6.13.1` and\n`katex@0.13.18`. To install the latter with `npm` you can run\n```npm install -g katex@0.13.18```\n\n### Previous Versions\n\nInstallation instructions and binaries for previous PyTorch versions may be found\non [our website](https://pytorch.org/previous-versions).\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThree-pointers to get you started:\n- [Tutorials: get you started with understanding and using PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/)\n- [Examples: easy to understand PyTorch code across all domains](https://github.com/pytorch/examples)\n- [The API Reference](https://pytorch.org/docs/)\n- [Glossary](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/GLOSSARY.md)\n\n## Resources\n\n* [PyTorch.org](https://pytorch.org/)\n* [PyTorch Tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/)\n* [PyTorch Examples](https://github.com/pytorch/examples)\n* [PyTorch Models](https://pytorch.org/hub/)\n* [Intro to Deep Learning with PyTorch from Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-pytorch--ud188)\n* [Intro to Machine Learning with PyTorch from Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning-nanodegree--nd229)\n* [Deep Neural Networks with PyTorch from Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-networks-with-pytorch)\n* [PyTorch Twitter](https://twitter.com/PyTorch)\n* [PyTorch Blog](https://pytorch.org/blog/)\n* [PyTorch YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWXI5YeOsh03QvJ59PMaXFw)\n\n## Communication\n* Forums: Discuss implementations, research, etc. https://discuss.pytorch.org\n* GitHub Issues: Bug reports, feature requests, install issues, RFCs, thoughts, etc.\n* Slack: The [PyTorch Slack](https://pytorch.slack.com/) hosts a primary audience of moderate to experienced PyTorch users and developers for general chat, online discussions, collaboration, etc. If you are a beginner looking for help, the primary medium is [PyTorch Forums](https://discuss.pytorch.org).

After you start an Instruments session, near the top left of the window, click on the process that instruments is set to record, and then select \"choose target\"\r\n2. (That should open an explorer window allowing you to select executables to profile--this is the picture in Malfet's post)\r\n3. Find the python executable you want to use (if you're using an environment manager, like conda, make sure to select the python executable for the environment with the pytorch package you're interested in). \r\n--for example, I'm using conda, and the pytorch version I wanted to use is in my \"pytorch\" env, so the python executable I selected was at /opt/homebrew/caskroom/miniforge/base/envs/pytorch/bin/python3. To figure out where yours is, look at the output of \"which python\" or \"which python3\" in a terminal session configured to run your script.\r\n4. Once you've selected the correct python executable, enter the path to the script you want to profile in the \"arguments\" textbox near the bottom of the process selection window.\r\n5. Confirm your selection by clicking \"choose\"\r\n6. Run the profiler (make sure to include the os_signpost instrument, but it seems like you know how to do that already)",

Your choice is either run the binary blob or... not use the model at all.\r\n\r\nI would like to suggest moving to a default serialization format which does not rely on arbitrary code execution. Ideally the format would also be based on some standard so that it could be easily read by other tools.\r\n\r\nA `load_insecure()` function could be retained for backwards compatibility with older models, but the important thing is that new models be saved to a safer format by default.\r\n\r\nI did notice that the docs for `torch.save()` mention a new \"zip-file based serialization format\". However, it is not documented whether this new format is also vulnerable to RCE.

                "body": "Hi!\r\n\r\nI've been fuzzing different pytorch modules, and found a crash inside one of them.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I'm talking about a module for unpickling and a function called `Unpickler::readInstruction()`. Running this function with provided crash file results in a crash, which occurs while calling `auto dict = stack_.at(dict_pos).toGenericDict();` [unpickler.cpp:561](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/0e94fbc0c8ab1572c88159c1a4c397b6eb824c01/torch/csrc/jit/serialization/unpickler.cpp#L561). The crash occurs, because the index `dict_pos` is out of bounds (which itself happens because the stack size is 0).\r\n\r\nBesides this pull-request, there is another one related to unpickler hardening: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/84343\r\n\r\nAll tests were performed on this pytorch version: [abc54f93145830b502400faa92bec86e05422fbd](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/tree/abc54f93145830b502400faa92bec86e05422fbd)\r\n\r\n### How to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. To reproduce the crash, use provided docker: [Dockerfile](https://github.com/ispras/oss-sydr-fuzz/tree/master/projects/pytorch)\r\n\r\n2. Build the container: `docker build -t oss-sydr-fuzz-pytorch-reproduce .`\r\n\r\n3. Copy crash file to the current directory:\r\n\r\n    - [crash-042dff5e121580425d9d34d0f293918f3c9fbf1e.zip](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/files/10674361/crash-042dff5e121580425d9d34d0f293918f3c9fbf1e.zip)\r\n\r\n4. Run the container: ``docker run --privileged --network host -v `pwd`:/homedir --rm -it oss-sydr-fuzz-pytorch-reproduce /bin/bash``\r\n\r\n5. And execute the binary: `/message_deserialize_sydr /homedir/crash-042dff5e121580425d9d34d0f293918f3c9fbf1e`\r\n\r\nAfter execution completes you will see this error message:\r\n\r\n```txt\r\nterminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::out_of_range'\r\n  what():  vector::_M_range_check: __n (which is 18446744073709551613) >= this->size() (which is 0)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this stacktrace:\r\n\r\n```asan\r\nerminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::out_of_range'\r\n  what():  vector::_M_range_check: __n (which is 18446744073709551613) >= this->size() (which is 0)\r\n==39== ERROR: libFuzzer: deadly signal\r\n    #0 0x5d0df1 in __sanitizer_print_stack_trace /llvm-project/compiler-rt/lib/asan/asan_stack.cpp:87:3\r\n    #1 0x545727 in fuzzer::PrintStackTrace() /llvm-project/compiler-rt/lib/fuzzer/FuzzerUtil.cpp:210:5\r\n    #2 0x52b933 in fuzzer::Fuzzer::CrashCallback() /llvm-project/compiler-rt/lib/fuzzer/FuzzerLoop.cpp:233:3\r\n    #3 0x7f9118e0341f  (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0+0x1441f)\r\n    #4 0x7f9118c2300a in raise (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6+0x4300a)\r\n    #5 0x7f9118c02858 in abort (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6+0x22858)\r\n    #6 0x7f9119040910  (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6+0x9e910)\r\n    #7 0x7f911904c38b  (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6+0xaa38b)\r\n    #8 0x7f911904c3f6 in std::terminate() (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6+0xaa3f6)\r\n    #9 0x7f911904c6a8 in __cxa_throw (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6+0xaa6a8)\r\n    #10 0x7f91190433aa  (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6+0xa13aa)\r\n    #11 0x63acdf in std::vector<c10::IValue, std::allocator<c10::IValue> >::_M_range_check(unsigned long) const /usr/bin/../lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/10/../../../../include/c++/10/bits/stl_vector.h:1073:4\r\n    #12 0xce8f93e in std::vector<c10::IValue, std::allocator<c10::IValue> >::at(unsigned long) /usr/bin/../lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/10/../../../../include/c++/10/bits/stl_vector.h:1094:2\r\n    #13 0xce8f93e in torch::jit::Unpickler::readInstruction() /pytorch_fuzz/torch/csrc/jit/serialization/unpickler.cpp:546:26\r\n    #14 0xce8d527 in torch::jit::Unpickler::run() /pytorch_fuzz/torch/csrc/jit/serialization/unpickler.cpp:235:27\r\n    #15 0xce8d1c2 in torch::jit::Unpickler::parse_ivalue() /pytorch_fuzz/torch/csrc/jit/serialization/unpickler.cpp:192:3\r\n    #16 0xcdf0792 in torch::jit::unpickle(std::function<unsigned long (char*, unsigned long)>, std::function<c10::StrongTypePtr (c10::QualifiedName const&)>, c10::ArrayRef<at::Tensor>, c10::Type::SingletonOrSharedTypePtr<c10::Type> (*)(std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > const&)) /pytorch_fuzz/torch/csrc/jit/serialization/pickle.cpp:127:20\r\n    #17 0xcdf104d in torch::jit::unpickle(char const*, unsigned long, std::function<c10::StrongTypePtr (c10::QualifiedName const&)>, c10::ArrayRef<at::Tensor>, c10::Type::SingletonOrSharedTypePtr<c10::Type> (*)(std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > const&)) /pytorch_fuzz/torch/csrc/jit/serialization/pickle.cpp:137:10\r\n    #18 0xe0532db in torch::distributed::rpc::ScriptRemoteCall::fromMessage(torch::distributed::rpc::Message const&) /pytorch_fuzz/torch/csrc/distributed/rpc/script_remote_call.cpp:74:16\r\n    #19 0xe0ffa10 in torch::distributed::rpc::deserializeRequest(torch::distributed::rpc::Message const&) /pytorch_fuzz/torch/csrc/distributed/rpc/utils.cpp:108:14\r\n    #20 0x602a41 in LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput /message_deserialize_fuzz.cc:192:27\r\n    #21 0x52ce61 in fuzzer::Fuzzer::ExecuteCallback(unsigned char const*, unsigned long) /llvm-project/compiler-rt/lib/fuzzer/FuzzerLoop.cpp:611:15\r\n    #22 0x516d7c in fuzzer::RunOneTest(fuzzer::Fuzzer*, char const*, unsigned long) /llvm-project/compiler-rt/lib/fuzzer/FuzzerDriver.cpp:324:6\r\n    #23 0x51cacb in fuzzer::FuzzerDriver(int*, char***, int (*)(unsigned char const*, unsigned long)) /llvm-project/compiler-rt/lib/fuzzer/FuzzerDriver.cpp:860:9\r\n    #24 0x546062 in main /llvm-project/compiler-rt/lib/fuzzer/FuzzerMain.cpp:20:10\r\n    #25 0x7f9118c04082 in __libc_start_main (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6+0x24082)\r\n    #26 0x51169d in _start (/message_deserialize_fuzz+0x51169d)\r\n\r\nNOTE: libFuzzer has rudimentary signal handlers.\r\n      Combine libFuzzer with AddressSanitizer or similar for better crash reports.\r\nSUMMARY: libFuzzer: deadly signal\r\n```",

I found two package names that I could register on pypi (torchaudio-nightly, pytorch-csprng).\r\n\r\nI reported this to facebook's bugbounty program (as your security policy says), however it seems facebook no longer is responsible here (see also #91570). Facebook's security team came to the conclusion that the issue is not severe.\r\n\r\nNevertheless I now have registered these package names on pypi and I am wondering what to do with them. I would prefer to transmit ownership of the account to the pytorch team so you can decide what to do with them and if you want to keep them registered to block the names.\n\n### Versions\n\nirrelevant/nightly\n\ncc @seemethere @malfet @osalpekar @atalman @ezyang",

Bug Bounty Program Info](https://www.facebook.com/whitehat) with a wall of text and where it's not clear which parts applies to Meta/Facbook only and which to PyTorch. On a side note, I do not have a Facbook account. So this seems rather impractical, and I can now choose whether to (a) just report right to the public issue tracker or (b) not report at all.

And in `CVE-2022-0845`, this bug is also caused by using `eval` to parse the args so it leads to code injection, and it seems also must have an access to local python. To be honest, I don't know how people think about these kind of problems, but we need to pay more attention :p. So we need a discuss about it whether it can be considered as a big security problem.",

Also I've found that PaddlePaddle has also `eval` problems (https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle/blob/develop/security/advisory/pdsa-2022-002.md). But sometimes, if we do not use `eval`, the code will become much more complex. Maybe developers can just add a critical check about the parameters of the function to avoid this problem easily (if possible). ",

                "body": "## Issue description\r\n\r\nHello, I'm working on behalf of Google and the [OpenSSF][ossf] to help essential open-source projects improve their supply-chain security. The OpenSSF is a non-profit foundation backed by the Linux Foundation, dedicated to improving the security of the open-source community. It counts both GitHub and Facebook as [members][ossf-membership].\r\n\r\nDue to PyTorch's importance in the Python ML landscape, the OpenSSF has included it to its list of the 100 most critical open-source projects. Given the volumes of frequently sensitive information consumed by applications reliant on PyTorch, the OpenSSF wants to help harden the project's supply-chain.\r\n\r\nTo this end, the OpenSSF has designed the [Scorecard][sc] system, which combines dozens of automated checks to let maintainers better understand their project's supply-chain security posture. There is also the [Scorecard GitHub Action][sc-gha], which adds the results of its checks to the project's [security dashboard](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/security), as well as suggestions on how to solve any issues (see examples below). This Action has been adopted by 1600+ projects already, including TensorFlow.\r\n\r\nWould you be interested in a PR which adds this Action? Optionally, it can also publish your results to the OpenSSF REST API, which allows a [badge][badge] with the project's score to be added to its README.\r\n\r\n![Code scanning dashboard with multiple alerts, including Code-Review and Token-Permissions][img-security]\r\n\r\n![Detail of a Token-Permissions alert, indicating the specific file and remediation steps][img-detail]\r\n\r\n[badge]: https://openssf.org/blog/2022/09/08/show-off-your-security-score-announcing-scorecards-badges/\r\n[ossf]: https://openssf.org/\r\n[ossf-membership]: https://openssf.org/about/members/\r\n[sc]: https://github.com/ossf/scorecard\r\n[sc-blog]: https://github.blog/2022-01-19-reducing-security-risk-oss-actions-opensff-scorecards-v4/\r\n[sc-gha]: https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action\r\n[img-security]: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15221358/190184391-84ca1844-259a-4b3b-9c86-74adadbea7f1.png\r\n[img-detail]: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15221358/190184600-ee8d3b39-077e-416a-8711-1b5fb01cf0b3.png\r\n\n\ncc @seemethere @malfet @pytorch/pytorch-dev-infra",

This makes it very lightweight (usually takes around a minute to run) since it isn't actually \"doing\" much.\r\n\r\nThe cvxpy link above is to the PR that implemented the Action if you'd like to take a look. That PR includes the README badge, but given PyTorch doesn't display any other badges, I naturally wouldn't add it here (unless you want it!).",

Should we not to use their models because we don't trust them?\r\n\r\nSo we need not attribution in the first place, but a proof that any model cannot compromise integrity of a system and confidentiality of the information processed in it in some sensible threat model.

For that, I'd guess one would need to map more python types to HDF5 datasets (usually is fine for python scalars, strings, arrays, dicts; but will require some mapping for sparse pytorch arrays, preferrably just dumping the internal representation as is but maybe including some meta information in array names or in a separate field). I'm not very sure, it's not needed, but it might also provide natively mmap-loading/rewriting of a given array slice and some native compression.",

My vision:\r\n- a serialization mechanism that is currently officially supported uses pickle (protocol=2) to store/load weights. Usage described [here](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/notes/serialization.html)\r\n- pickle is unsafe \r\n- pytorch supports exporting to ONNX, but not importing\r\n\r\n# Proposal \r\n\r\nUse ONNX format, but use only initializers field to store a model's state.\r\n\r\n## Pros\r\n\r\n- Safe\r\n- Relies on already existing format with good tooling; needed protobuf-code is already in pytorch source. If needed, weights can be read from other languages\r\n- Proposed implementation (see later) stores parameters that are met in the model state several times, loading does not break this situation (if parameters used the same tensor, they use the same tensor after loading)\r\n- Proposed implementation was checked to normally import / export all (largest) torchvision models: inception_v3, alexnet, densenet201, resnet152, squeezenet1_1, vgg19_bn.\r\n\r\n## Cons \r\n\r\n- No support for serialization of sparse tensors.

After you start an Instruments session, near the top left of the window, click on the process that instruments is set to record, and then select \"choose target\"\r\n2. (That should open an explorer window allowing you to select executables to profile--this is the picture in Malfet's post)\r\n3. Find the python executable you want to use (if you're using an environment manager, like conda, make sure to select the python executable for the environment with the pytorch package you're interested in). \r\n--for example, I'm using conda, and the pytorch version I wanted to use is in my \"pytorch\" env, so the python executable I selected was at /opt/homebrew/caskroom/miniforge/base/envs/pytorch/bin/python3. To figure out where yours is, look at the output of \"which python\" or \"which python3\" in a terminal session configured to run your script.\r\n4. Once you've selected the correct python executable, enter the path to the script you want to profile in the \"arguments\" textbox near the bottom of the process selection window.\r\n5. Confirm your selection by clicking \"choose\"\r\n6. Run the profiler (make sure to include the os_signpost instrument, but it seems like you know how to do that already)",

Your choice is either run the binary blob or... not use the model at all.\r\n\r\nI would like to suggest moving to a default serialization format which does not rely on arbitrary code execution. Ideally the format would also be based on some standard so that it could be easily read by other tools.\r\n\r\nA `load_insecure()` function could be retained for backwards compatibility with older models, but the important thing is that new models be saved to a safer format by default.\r\n\r\nI did notice that the docs for `torch.save()` mention a new \"zip-file based serialization format\". However, it is not documented whether this new format is also vulnerable to RCE. Furthermore, there doesn't appear to be an option in `pytorch.load()` to reject the older *definitely insecure* format.\n\n### Versions\n\nN/A",

                "body": "Hi!\r\n\r\nI've been fuzzing different pytorch modules, and found a crash inside one of them.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I'm talking about a module for unpickling and a function called `Unpickler::readInstruction()`. Running this function with provided crash file results in a crash, which occurs while calling `auto dict = stack_.at(dict_pos).toGenericDict();` [unpickler.cpp:561](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/0e94fbc0c8ab1572c88159c1a4c397b6eb824c01/torch/csrc/jit/serialization/unpickler.cpp#L561). The crash occurs, because the index `dict_pos` is out of bounds (which itself happens because the stack size is 0).\r\n\r\nBesides this pull-request, there is another one related to unpickler hardening: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/84343\r\n\r\nAll tests were performed on this pytorch version: [abc54f93145830b502400faa92bec86e05422fbd](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/tree/abc54f93145830b502400faa92bec86e05422fbd)\r\n\r\n### How to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. To reproduce the crash, use provided docker: [Dockerfile](https://github.com/ispras/oss-sydr-fuzz/tree/master/projects/pytorch)\r\n\r\n2. Build the container: `docker build -t oss-sydr-fuzz-pytorch-reproduce .`\r\n\r\n3. Copy crash file to the current directory:\r\n\r\n    - [crash-042dff5e121580425d9d34d0f293918f3c9fbf1e.zip](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/files/10674361/crash-042dff5e121580425d9d34d0f293918f3c9fbf1e.zip)\r\n\r\n4. Run the container: ``docker run --privileged --network host -v `pwd`:/homedir --rm -it oss-sydr-fuzz-pytorch-reproduce /bin/bash``\r\n\r\n5. And execute the binary: `/message_deserialize_sydr /homedir/crash-042dff5e121580425d9d34d0f293918f3c9fbf1e`\r\n\r\nAfter execution completes you will see this error message:\r\n\r\n```txt\r\nterminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::out_of_range'\r\n  what():  vector::_M_range_check: __n (which is 18446744073709551613) >= this->size() (which is 0)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this stacktrace:\r\n\r\n```asan\r\nerminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::out_of_range'\r\n  what():  vector::_M_range_check: __n (which is 18446744073709551613) >= this->size() (which is 0)\r\n==39== ERROR: libFuzzer: deadly signal\r\n    #0 0x5d0df1 in __sanitizer_print_stack_trace /llvm-project/compiler-rt/lib/asan/asan_stack.cpp:87:3\r\n    #1 0x545727 in fuzzer::PrintStackTrace() /llvm-project/compiler-rt/lib/fuzzer/FuzzerUtil.cpp:210:5\r\n    #2 0x52b933 in fuzzer::Fuzzer::CrashCallback() /llvm-project/compiler-rt/lib/fuzzer/FuzzerLoop.cpp:233:3\r\n    #3 0x7f9118e0341f  (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0+0x1441f)\r\n    #4 0x7f9118c2300a in raise (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6+0x4300a)\r\n    #5 0x7f9118c02858 in abort (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6+0x22858)\r\n    #6 0x7f9119040910  (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6+0x9e910)\r\n    #7 0x7f911904c38b  (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6+0xaa38b)\r\n    #8 0x7f911904c3f6 in std::terminate() (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6+0xaa3f6)\r\n    #9 0x7f911904c6a8 in __cxa_throw (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6+0xaa6a8)\r\n    #10 0x7f91190433aa  (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6+0xa13aa)\r\n    #11 0x63acdf in std::vector<c10::IValue, std::allocator<c10::IValue> >::_M_range_check(unsigned long) const /usr/bin/../lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/10/../../../../include/c++/10/bits/stl_vector.h:1073:4\r\n    #12 0xce8f93e in std::vector<c10::IValue, std::allocator<c10::IValue> >::at(unsigned long) /usr/bin/../lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/10/../../../../include/c++/10/bits/stl_vector.h:1094:2\r\n    #13 0xce8f93e in torch::jit::Unpickler::readInstruction() /pytorch_fuzz/torch/csrc/jit/serialization/unpickler.cpp:546:26\r\n    #14 0xce8d527 in torch::jit::Unpickler::run() /pytorch_fuzz/torch/csrc/jit/serialization/unpickler.cpp:235:27\r\n    #15 0xce8d1c2 in torch::jit::Unpickler::parse_ivalue() /pytorch_fuzz/torch/csrc/jit/serialization/unpickler.cpp:192:3\r\n    #16 0xcdf0792 in torch::jit::unpickle(std::function<unsigned long (char*, unsigned long)>, std::function<c10::StrongTypePtr (c10::QualifiedName const&)>, c10::ArrayRef<at::Tensor>, c10::Type::SingletonOrSharedTypePtr<c10::Type> (*)(std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > const&)) /pytorch_fuzz/torch/csrc/jit/serialization/pickle.cpp:127:20\r\n    #17 0xcdf104d in torch::jit::unpickle(char const*, unsigned long, std::function<c10::StrongTypePtr (c10::QualifiedName const&)>, c10::ArrayRef<at::Tensor>, c10::Type::SingletonOrSharedTypePtr<c10::Type> (*)(std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > const&)) /pytorch_fuzz/torch/csrc/jit/serialization/pickle.cpp:137:10\r\n    #18 0xe0532db in torch::distributed::rpc::ScriptRemoteCall::fromMessage(torch::distributed::rpc::Message const&) /pytorch_fuzz/torch/csrc/distributed/rpc/script_remote_call.cpp:74:16\r\n    #19 0xe0ffa10 in torch::distributed::rpc::deserializeRequest(torch::distributed::rpc::Message const&) /pytorch_fuzz/torch/csrc/distributed/rpc/utils.cpp:108:14\r\n    #20 0x602a41 in LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput /message_deserialize_fuzz.cc:192:27\r\n    #21 0x52ce61 in fuzzer::Fuzzer::ExecuteCallback(unsigned char const*, unsigned long) /llvm-project/compiler-rt/lib/fuzzer/FuzzerLoop.cpp:611:15\r\n    #22 0x516d7c in fuzzer::RunOneTest(fuzzer::Fuzzer*, char const*, unsigned long) /llvm-project/compiler-rt/lib/fuzzer/FuzzerDriver.cpp:324:6\r\n    #23 0x51cacb in fuzzer::FuzzerDriver(int*, char***, int (*)(unsigned char const*, unsigned long)) /llvm-project/compiler-rt/lib/fuzzer/FuzzerDriver.cpp:860:9\r\n    #24 0x546062 in main /llvm-project/compiler-rt/lib/fuzzer/FuzzerMain.cpp:20:10\r\n    #25 0x7f9118c04082 in __libc_start_main (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6+0x24082)\r\n    #26 0x51169d in _start (/message_deserialize_fuzz+0x51169d)\r\n\r\nNOTE: libFuzzer has rudimentary signal handlers.\r\n      Combine libFuzzer with AddressSanitizer or similar for better crash reports.\r\nSUMMARY: libFuzzer: deadly signal\r\n```",

I found two package names that I could register on pypi (torchaudio-nightly, pytorch-csprng).\r\n\r\nI reported this to facebook's bugbounty program (as your security policy says), however it seems facebook no longer is responsible here (see also #91570). Facebook's security team came to the conclusion that the issue is not severe.\r\n\r\nNevertheless I now have registered these package names on pypi and I am wondering what to do with them. I would prefer to transmit ownership of the account to the pytorch team so you can decide what to do with them and if you want to keep them registered to block the names.\n\n### Versions\n\nirrelevant/nightly\n\ncc @seemethere @malfet @osalpekar @atalman @ezyang",

Bug Bounty Program Info](https://www.facebook.com/whitehat) with a wall of text and where it's not clear which parts applies to Meta/Facbook only and which to PyTorch. On a side note, I do not have a Facbook account. So this seems rather impractical, and I can now choose whether to (a) just report right to the public issue tracker or (b) not report at all.

And in `CVE-2022-0845`, this bug is also caused by using `eval` to parse the args so it leads to code injection, and it seems also must have an access to local python. To be honest, I don't know how people think about these kind of problems, but we need to pay more attention :p. So we need a discuss about it whether it can be considered as a big security problem.",

Also I've found that PaddlePaddle has also `eval` problems (https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle/blob/develop/security/advisory/pdsa-2022-002.md). But sometimes, if we do not use `eval`, the code will become much more complex.

The OpenSSF is a non-profit foundation backed by the Linux Foundation, dedicated to improving the security of the open-source community. It counts both GitHub and Facebook as [members][ossf-membership].\r\n\r\nDue to PyTorch's importance in the Python ML landscape, the OpenSSF has included it to its list of the 100 most critical open-source projects. Given the volumes of frequently sensitive information consumed by applications reliant on PyTorch, the OpenSSF wants to help harden the project's supply-chain.\r\n\r\nTo this end, the OpenSSF has designed the [Scorecard][sc] system, which combines dozens of automated checks to let maintainers better understand their project's supply-chain security posture. There is also the [Scorecard GitHub Action][sc-gha], which adds the results of its checks to the project's [security dashboard](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/security), as well as suggestions on how to solve any issues (see examples below). This Action has been adopted by 1600+ projects already, including TensorFlow.\r\n\r\nWould you be interested in a PR which adds this Action? Optionally, it can also publish your results to the OpenSSF REST API, which allows a [badge][badge] with the project's score to be added to its README.\r\n\r\n![Code scanning dashboard with multiple alerts, including Code-Review and Token-Permissions][img-security]\r\n\r\n![Detail of a Token-Permissions alert, indicating the specific file and remediation steps][img-detail]\r\n\r\n[badge]: https://openssf.org/blog/2022/09/08/show-off-your-security-score-announcing-scorecards-badges/\r\n[ossf]: https://openssf.org/\r\n[ossf-membership]: https://openssf.org/about/members/\r\n[sc]: https://github.com/ossf/scorecard\r\n[sc-blog]: https://github.blog/2022-01-19-reducing-security-risk-oss-actions-opensff-scorecards-v4/\r\n[sc-gha]: https://github.com/ossf/scorecard-action\r\n[img-security]: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15221358/190184391-84ca1844-259a-4b3b-9c86-74adadbea7f1.png\r\n[img-detail]: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15221358/190184600-ee8d3b39-077e-416a-8711-1b5fb01cf0b3.png\r\n\n\ncc @seemethere @malfet @pytorch/pytorch-dev-infra",

Our full documentation is available on `ipython.readthedocs.io\n<https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ and contains information on how to install, use, and\ncontribute to the project.\nIPython (Interactive Python) is a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages, originally developed for the Python programming language, that offers introspection, rich media, shell syntax, tab completion, and history.\n\n**IPython versions and Python Support**\n\nStarting after IPython 8.16, we will progressively transition to `Spec-0000 <https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0000/>`_.\n\nStarting with IPython 7.10, IPython follows `NEP 29 <https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html>`_\n\n**IPython 7.17+** requires Python version 3.7 and above.\n\n**IPython 7.10+** requires Python version 3.6 and above.\n\n**IPython 7.0** requires Python version 3.5 and above.\n\n**IPython 6.x** requires Python version 3.3 and above.\n\n**IPython 5.x LTS** is the compatible release for Python 2.7.\nIf you require Python 2 support, you **must** use IPython 5.x LTS. Please\nupdate your project configurations and requirements as necessary.\n\n\nThe Notebook, Qt console and a number of other pieces are now parts of *Jupyter*.\nSee the `Jupyter installation docs <https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html>`__\nif you want to use these.\n\nMain features of IPython\n========================\nComprehensive object introspection.\n\nInput history, persistent across sessions.\n\nCaching of output results during a session with automatically generated references.\n\nExtensible tab completion, with support by default for completion of python variables and keywords, filenames and function keywords.\n\nExtensible system of ‘magic’ commands for controlling the environment and performing many tasks related to IPython or the operating system.\n\nA rich configuration system with easy switching between different setups (simpler than changing $PYTHONSTARTUP environment variables every time).\n\nSession logging and reloading.\n\nExtensible syntax processing for special purpose situations.\n\nAccess to the system shell with user-extensible alias system.\n\nEasily embeddable in other Python programs and GUIs.\n\nIntegrated access to the pdb debugger and the Python profiler.\n\n\nDevelopment and Instant running\n===============================\n\nYou can find the latest version of the development documentation on `readthedocs\n<https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.\n\nYou can run IPython from this directory without even installing it system-wide\nby typing at the terminal::\n\n   $ python -m IPython\n\nOr see the `development installation docs\n<https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/install.html#installing-the-development-version>`_\nfor the latest revision on read the docs.\n\nDocumentation and installation instructions for older version of IPython can be\nfound on the `IPython website <https://ipython.org/documentation.html>`_\n\n\nAlternatives to IPython\n=======================\n\nIPython may not be to your taste; if that's the case there might be similar\nproject that you might want to use:\n\n- The classic Python REPL.\n- `bpython <https://bpython-interpreter.org/>`_\n- `mypython <https://www.asmeurer.com/mypython/>`_\n- `ptpython and ptipython <https://pypi.org/project/ptpython/>`_\n- `Xonsh <https://xon.sh/>`_\n\nIgnoring commits with git blame.ignoreRevsFile\n==============================================\n\nAs of git 2.23, it is possible to make formatting changes without breaking\n``git blame``. See the `git documentation\n<https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-blameignoreRevsFile>`_\nfor more details.\n\nTo use this feature you must:\n\n- Install git >= 2.23\n- Configure your local git repo by running:\n   - POSIX: ``tools\\configure-git-blame-ignore-revs.sh``\n   - Windows:  ``tools\\configure-git-blame-ignore-revs.bat``\n",

                "body": "Hi IPython,\r\n\r\nFirst off, I'd like to say how much I enjoy using IPython - I use it every day. Recently I've begun work on a [static analysis tool](https://github.com/dlint-py/dlint) for Python code. I ran a subset of its rules against the IPython code base and received some interesting results. In particular, Dlint's checks for `shell=True` subprocess calls:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ python3 -m flake8 --select=DUO116 ipython/IPython/\r\nipython/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py:2482:22: DUO116 use of \"shell=True\" is insecure in \"subprocess\" module\r\nipython/IPython/core/hooks.py:80:12: DUO116 use of \"shell=True\" is insecure in \"subprocess\" module\r\nipython/IPython/core/page.py:214:24: DUO116 use of \"shell=True\" is insecure in \"subprocess\" module\r\nipython/IPython/lib/editorhooks.py:55:16: DUO116 use of \"shell=True\" is insecure in \"subprocess\" module\r\nipython/IPython/utils/_process_common.py:79:9: DUO116 use of \"shell=True\" is insecure in \"subprocess\" module\r\nipython/IPython/utils/sysinfo.py:58:12: DUO116 use of \"shell=True\" is insecure in \"subprocess\" module\r\n```\r\n\r\nI manually investigated each finding with the following results:\r\n\r\n* `interactiveshell.py`: Unclear if vulnerable, unclear if `shell=True` is necessary\r\n* `hooks.py`: Vulnerable via `$EDITOR, shell=True` unnecessary\r\n* `page.py`: Vulnerable via `$PAGER`, `shell=True` unnecessary\r\n* `editorhooks.py`: Unclear if vulnerable, unclear if shell=True is necessary\r\n* `_process_commend.py`: Unclear if vulnerable, seems shell=True is necessary\r\n* `sysinfo.py`: Not vulnerable, `shell=True` unnecessary\r\n\r\nThe following demonstrates the vulnerabilities in hooks and page:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ PAGER='echo \"pager\" > /tmp/pager' ipython -c \"open??\"\r\n$ cat /tmp/pager\r\npager\r\n```\r\n```\r\n$ EDITOR='echo \"editor\" > /tmp/editor' ipython -c \"%edit\"\r\n$ cat /tmp/editor\r\neditor\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis issue is highlighted in the Python subprocess docs: [Subprocess Security Considerations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#security-considerations). This issue falls under CWE-77: [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/77.html). I would recommend avoiding `shell=True` whenever possible and investigating the other findings and ensuring they do not have the same issue. It appears that most of the calls do not need shell functionality anyway.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you need any additional information!",

                        "body": "Note: This conversation already happen on the security mailing list and is posted in public for transparency. \r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\n@Carreau replied\r\n\r\nHi Matt,\r\n\r\nMany thanks for the kind words, and thanks for the report, and for\r\npointing us to dlint..\r\n\r\nA few questions and discussion though.\r\nAs far as I understand,  \"Command injection\" usually refer to\r\napplication that are not meant to run arbitrary command. But do so\r\nunder adversarial user input.\r\n\r\n1) The goal of IPython **is** to run arbitrary commands; If you run\r\ncan run IPython, or enter commands into it you don't need to modify\r\n$PAGER or $EDITOR to execute arbitrary commands. I'm also unsure how\r\nan attacker would modify those env variable or provide adversarial\r\ninput.\r\n2) I believe the `shell=True` is necessary (at least ini `$EDITOR`) in\r\nboth the case you outline we do want to explicitly run arbitrary\r\ncommands. For example $EDITOR='atom -w' to have a blocking GUI editor\r\nafter calling `%edit`. `Shell=False` will say `no such command 'atom\r\n-w'` – I guess those can be handled by `shlex.split()`, but other like\r\nipython -c '%sx echo \"onpurpose\" > /tmp/onpurpose' really must use\r\nshell (sx stands for shell execute).\r\n\r\nSo I'd like to better understand what your threat model is, or would\r\nbe for such attacks.\r\nDoes \"Command injection\" really make sens when the goal of the project\r\nis arbitrary code  execution, or if I misunderstood some of the issues\r\nbehind command injections.\r\n\r\nI understand that some of the above would be cleaner w/o shell=True,\r\nat least to show good practice.\r\n\r\nLet us know what you think, and wether there is a need to keep this\r\nprivate; in which case i'm open to have this public on the IPython\r\nrepo and/or do a security advisory.\r\n\r\n---- \r\n\r\n@takluyver replied\r\n\r\n$PAGER can also include options, e.g. \"less -R\". So we can't easily switch away from shell=True there.\r\n\r\nThe threat model here would have to be an attacker that can set environment variables for a context where IPython will be used, but not give IPython commands directly or write anywhere on the filesystem (because if you can do that, you can point one of these environment variables to a script you've written, which gets run even with 'shell=False'). I imagine you can come up with some scenario like that, but given how IPython is designed to be used, I suspect those scenarios are pretty unlikely. If you figure out potential improvements in that area, I'd discuss them in the open rather than through the private security channels.\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\n@mschwager replied\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nThanks for the clarifications. Based on your inputs it seems that there isn't much that can be done. Though I'd say avoiding shell=True is still a good practice :)\r\n\r\nSince IPython is mostly a CLI/development-focused tool, it's unlikely that it's used in such a way where these concerns are exploitable. However, there are probably places where it's being used in an unusual, hard to envision scenario. Further, the attacker would have to be somewhat constrained. As already mentioned, the attacker would have to be able to set env variables but not files on the filesystem. But even in this situation, defensive programming (such as shlex or no shell) wouldn't stop something like: EDITOR='python -c \"<arbitrary code>\"' ipython ...\r\n\r\nIf we consider some of the previously mentioned concerns:\r\nRequiring arguments to script, e.g. 'atom -w': we could avoid shell=True here by using shlex.split. Although this still falls into trouble with the arbitrary code example above.\r\nHandling shell execute functionality, e.g. '%sx': there's not much to be done here, this is the intended behavior :)\r\nThinking about shell=True a bit more... I believe this is most dangerous when user input is being concatenated with an existing string. For example, consider the following:\r\n\r\ncmd = 'ls -l {}'\r\ncmd = cmd.format(cmd, user_input_directory)\r\nsubprocess.Popen(cmd, shell=True)\r\n\r\nThe dangerous part here is that user input could be 'foo; rm -rf /'. Adding shell=True enables multiple commands with ';'. Although the IPython codebase doesn't contain this behavior (or at least doesn't where code execution isn't intended).\r\n\r\nAll in all I'd say that there's no security issues here. Although I would say shlex instead of shell=True would generally be better practice.\r\n\r\nI appreciate all your feedback here and quick responses. I can use this to improve Dlint's analysis capabilities.\r\n\r\n",

Are there any other options that could be implemented? I'm sure that other people are interested in this as well especially now that Docker is a viable means provisioning per user notebooks.\n\n   What I am trying to do specifically is to add an HTTP Authorization header to each request that contains an authentication token, and have the handlers verify the validity of the token before servicing the request. Its easy to do and a common approach. I actually need access to the token for backend web service requests. I can override the front end HTML templates and have already modified the javascript to add the headers to the ajax requests, but I am blocked on the backend.\n\n   An alternative might be to setup configurable handlers for /login and /logout and have the front end register the authentication token with the login handler and receive a secure session cookie that references the . Code on the backend such as notebook handlers would have to have access to the session object to authenticate the user for access to data.\n\n   What do people think?\n   Steve\n",

Then the proxy would handle auth.\n\nAnyway, if you think specifically at one way to do that, I suggest for you to draft a proposal and/or submit a pull request.\n\nI would also suggest looking at `DottedObjectName` configurable, that can allow to use custom class for some object in IPython.\n\nYou can probably have a look at [bookstore](https://github.com/rgbkrk/bookstore) a python package that allow to use rackspace as a storage backend. \n\nIt is a good example of how to use that with a 4 config line (extract from above link) : \n\n```\n# Setup IPython Notebook to write notebooks to CloudFiles\nc.NotebookApp.notebook_manager_class = 'bookstore.cloudfiles.CloudFilesNotebookManager'\n\n# Set your user name and API Key\nc.CloudFilesNotebookManager.account_name = USER_NAME\nc.CloudFilesNotebookManager.account_key = API_KEY\n\n# Container on CloudFiles\nc.CloudFilesNotebookManager.container_name = u'notebooks'\n```\n",

However if you look at how pluggable authentication is handled in other web platforms, you'll probably see that what I suggested is a fairly conventional approach to dealing with a reasonable number of use cases. I would rather not fork the IPython core and send a PR without a reasonable belief that it would be acceptable to the IPython core devs - so some reasonable guidance about what would be acceptable/unacceptable in terms of design decisions would be helpful.\n\nAs far as having a front end proxy that instantiates new per user notebook instances, as you're no doubt aware, there's a bunch of people working on docker based solutions. We implemented a proof of concept with an nginx proxy + jiffylab, but I can't work on further it for a few weeks. I promised Paul Ivanov that I would upload the current duct tape and bailing wire prototype but haven't been able to scrape together the time for that yet. In the long term, my plan is to move most of the current jiffylab functionality into Nginx and enforce some level of authentication in the Nginx handlers - however that is a couple of months away, and will likely be using the Nginx embedded lua interpreter instead of python. It also doesn't solve the problem of making the authentication token available to a backend services like the notebook manager.\n\nThe example you posted uses a static username and password, so it doesn't support permissions based on user authentication. Thats really the problem, there needs to be a way to pass an authentication token from the web client through to the notebook manager and similar notebook server services, as well as a way to pass it through to the kernel - I implemented a monkeypatching solution for now on the notebook server and a parallel solution with frontend javascript calling into the kernel, but those are just hacks to get around the lack of support. I'll write up a strawman proposal to initiate discussion as you suggested, but it may take a couple of weeks until I'm past the current delivery crunch.\n\n   Steve\n",

Small data comes with different perspectives.\n\nThe smaller the amount of data to compress, the more difficult it is to compress. This problem is common to all compression algorithms, and reason is, compression algorithms learn from past data how to compress future data. But at the beginning of a new data set, there is no \"past\" to build upon.\n\nTo solve this situation, Zstd offers a __training mode__, which can be used to tune the algorithm for a selected type of data.\nTraining Zstandard is achieved by providing it with a few samples (one file per sample). The result of this training is stored in a file called \"dictionary\", which must be loaded before compression and decompression.\nUsing this dictionary, the compression ratio achievable on small data improves dramatically.\n\nThe following example uses the `github-users` [sample set](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/releases/tag/v1.1.3), created from [github public API](https://developer.github.com/v3/users/#get-all-users).\nIt consists of roughly 10K records weighing about 1KB each.\n\nCompression Ratio | Compression Speed | Decompression Speed\n------------------|-------------------|--------------------\n![Compression Ratio](doc/images/dict-cr.png \"Compression Ratio\") | ![Compression Speed](doc/images/dict-cs.png \"Compression Speed\") | ![Decompression Speed](doc/images/dict-ds.png \"Decompression Speed\")\n\n\nThese compression gains are achieved while simultaneously providing _faster_ compression and decompression speeds.\n\nTraining works if there is some correlation in a family of small data samples. The more data-specific a dictionary is, the more efficient it is (there is no _universal dictionary_).\nHence, deploying one dictionary per type of data will provide the greatest benefits.\nDictionary gains are mostly effective in the first few KB. Then, the compression algorithm will gradually use previously decoded content to better compress the rest of the file.\n\n### Dictionary compression How To:\n\n1. Create the dictionary\n\n   `zstd --train FullPathToTrainingSet/* -o dictionaryName`\n\n2. Compress with dictionary\n\n   `zstd -D dictionaryName FILE`\n\n3. Decompress with dictionary\n\n   `zstd -D dictionaryName --decompress FILE.zst`\n\n\n## Build instructions\n\n`make` is the officially maintained build system of this project.\nAll other build systems are \"compatible\" and 3rd-party maintained,\nthey may feature small differences in advanced options.\nWhen your system allows it, prefer using `make` to build `zstd` and `libzstd`.\n\n### Makefile\n\nIf your system is compatible with standard `make` (or `gmake`),\ninvoking `make` in root directory will generate `zstd` cli in root directory.\nIt will also create `libzstd` into `lib/`.\n\nOther available options include:\n- `make install` : create and install zstd cli, library and man pages\n- `make check` : create and run `zstd`, test its behavior on local platform\n\nThe `Makefile` follows the [GNU Standard Makefile conventions](https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Makefile-Conventions.html),\nallowing staged install, standard flags, directory variables and command variables.\n\nFor advanced use cases, specialized compilation flags which control binary generation\nare documented in [`lib/README.md`](lib/README.md#modular-build) for the `libzstd` library\nand in [`programs/README.md`](programs/README.md#compilation-variables) for the `zstd` CLI.\n\n### cmake\n\nA `cmake` project generator is provided within `build/cmake`.\nIt can generate Makefiles or other build scripts\nto create `zstd` binary, and `libzstd` dynamic and static libraries.\n\nBy default, `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` is set to `Release`.\n\n#### Support for Fat (Universal2) Output\n\n`zstd` can be built and installed with support for both Apple Silicon (M1/M2) as well as Intel by using CMake's Universal2 support.\nTo perform a Fat/Universal2 build and install use the following commands:\n\n```bash\ncmake -B build-cmake-debug -S build/cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=\"x86_64;x86_64h;arm64\"\ncd build-cmake-debug\nninja\nsudo ninja install\n```\n\n### Meson\n\nA Meson project is provided within [`build/meson`](build/meson). Follow\nbuild instructions in that directory.\n\nYou can also take a look at [`.travis.yml`](.travis.yml) file for an\nexample about how Meson is used to build this project.\n\nNote that default build type is **release**.\n\n### VCPKG\nYou can build and install zstd [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/) dependency manager:\n\n    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git\n    cd vcpkg\n    ./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh\n    ./vcpkg integrate install\n    ./vcpkg install zstd\n\nThe zstd port in vcpkg is kept up to date by Microsoft team members and community contributors.\nIf the version is out of date, please [create an issue or pull request](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) on the vcpkg repository.\n\n### Conan\n\nYou can install pre-built binaries for zstd or build it from source using [Conan](https://conan.io/). Use the following command:\n\n```bash\nconan install --requires=\"zstd/[*]\" --build=missing\n```\n\nThe zstd Conan recipe is kept up to date by Conan maintainers and community contributors.\nIf the version is out of date, please [create an issue or pull request](https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index) on the ConanCenterIndex repository.\n\n### Visual Studio (Windows)\n\nGoing into `build` directory, you will find additional possibilities:\n- Projects for Visual Studio 2005, 2008 and 2010.\n  + VS2010 project is compatible with VS2012, VS2013, VS2015 and VS2017.\n- Automated build scripts for Visual compiler by [@KrzysFR](https://github.com/KrzysFR), in `build/VS_scripts`,\n  which will build `zstd` cli and `libzstd` library without any need to open Visual Studio solution.\n\n### Buck\n\nYou can build the zstd binary via buck by executing: `buck build programs:zstd` from the root of the repo.\nThe output binary will be in `buck-out/gen/programs/`.\n\n### Bazel\n\nYou easily can integrate zstd into your Bazel project by using the module hosted on the [Bazel Central Repository](https://registry.bazel.build/modules/zstd).\n\n## Testing\n\nYou can run quick local smoke tests by running `make check`.\nIf you can't use `make`, execute the `playTest.sh` script from the `src/tests` directory.\nTwo env variables `$ZSTD_BIN` and `$DATAGEN_BIN` are needed for the test script to locate the `zstd` and `datagen` binary.\nFor information on CI testing, please refer to `TESTING.md`.\n\n## Status\n\nZstandard is currently deployed within Facebook and many other large cloud infrastructures.\nIt is run continuously to compress large amounts of data in multiple formats and use cases.\nZstandard is considered safe for production environments.\n\n## License\n\nZstandard is dual-licensed under [BSD](LICENSE) OR [GPLv2](COPYING).\n\n## Contributing\n\nThe `dev` branch is the one where all contributions are merged before reaching `release`.\nIf you plan to propose a patch, please commit into the `dev` branch, or its own feature branch.\nDirect commit to `release` are not permitted.\nFor more information, please read [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n",

For a more detailed introduction, please visit our website's [User Guide](https://iotdb.apache.org/UserGuide/Master/QuickStart/QuickStart.html).\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nTo use IoTDB, you need to have:\n\n1. Java >= 1.8 (1.8, 11 to 17 are verified. Please make sure the environment path has been set accordingly).\n2. Maven >= 3.6 (If you want to compile and install IoTDB from source code).\n3. Set the max open files num as 65535 to avoid the \"too many open files\" error.\n4. (Optional) Set the somaxconn as 65535 to avoid \"connection reset\" error when the system is under high load.\n    ```\n    # Linux\n    > sudo sysctl -w net.core.somaxconn=65535\n   \n    # FreeBSD or Darwin\n    > sudo sysctl -w kern.ipc.somaxconn=65535\n    ```\n### Linux\n\n(This guide is based on an installation of Ubuntu 22.04.)\n\n#### Git\n\nMake sure `Git` is installed, if it's missing, simply install it via:\n\n    sudo apt install git\n\n#### Java\n\nMake sure `Java` is installed, if it's missing, simply install it via:\n\n    sudo apt install default-jdk\n\n#### Flex\n\n    sudo apt install flex\n\n#### Bison\n\n    sudo apt install bison\n\n#### Boost\n\n    sudo apt install libboost-all-dev\n\n#### OpenSSL header files\n\nUsually OpenSSL is already installed, however it's missing the header files we need to compile.\nSo ensure these are installed:\n\n    sudo apt install libssl-dev\n\n### Mac OS\n\n#### Git\n\nFirst ensure `git` works.\n\nUsually on a new Mac, as soon as you simply type `git` in a `Terminal` window, a popup will come up and ask if you want to finish installing the Mac developer tools. \nJust say yes.\nAs soon as this is finished, you are free to use `git`.\n\n#### Homebrew\n\nThen install `Homebrew` - If this hasn't been installed yet, as we are going to be installing everything using `Homebrew`.\n\n    /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n\n#### Java\n\nAs soon as that's done install `Java`, if this hasn't been installed yet:\n\n    brew install java\n\nDepending on your version of Homebrew, it will tell you to do one of the following (depending on the type of processor in your device).\n\nMainly on the Intel-based models:\n\n    sudo ln -sfn /usr/local/opt/openjdk/libexec/openjdk.jdk /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk.jdk\n\nMainly on the ARM-based models:\n\n    sudo ln -sfn /opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/libexec/openjdk.jdk /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk.jdk\n\n#### CPP Prerequisites \n\nBuilding `Thrift` requires us to add two more dependencies to the picture.\n\nThis however is only needed when enabling the `with-cpp` profile:\n\n    brew install boost\n    brew install bison\n    brew install openssl\n\n### Windows\n\n#### Chocolatey\n\nThen install `Chocolatey` - If this hasn't been installed yet, as we are going to be installing everything using `Chocolatey`.\n\nhttps://chocolatey.org/install\n\n#### Git\n\n    choco install git.install\n\n#### Java\n\n    choco install openjdk\n\n#### Visual Studio 19 2022\n\n    choco install visualstudio2022community\n    choco install visualstudio2022buildtools\n    choco install visualstudio2022-workload-nativedesktop\n\n#### Flex / Bison\n\n    choco install winflexbison\n\n#### Boost\n\n    choco install boost-msvc-14.2\n\n#### OpenSSL\n\n    choco install openssl\n\n## Installation\n\nIoTDB provides three installation methods, you can refer to the following suggestions, choose the one fits you best:\n\n* Installation from source code. If you need to modify the code yourself, you can use this method.\n* Installation from binary files. Download the binary files from the official website. This is the recommended method, in which you will get a binary released package which is out-of-the-box.\n* Using Docker：The path to the dockerfile is [here](https://github.com/apache/iotdb/tree/master/docker/src/main).\n\n\nHere in the Quick Start, we give a brief introduction of using source code to install IoTDB. For further information, please refer to [User Guide](https://iotdb.apache.org/UserGuide/Master/QuickStart/QuickStart.html).\n\n## Build from source\n\n### Prepare Thrift compiler\n\nSkip this chapter if you are using Windows. \n\nAs we use Thrift for our RPC module (communication and\nprotocol definition), we involve Thrift during the compilation, so Thrift compiler 0.13.0 (or\nhigher) is required to generate Thrift Java code. Thrift officially provides binary compiler for\nWindows, but unfortunately, they do not provide that for Unix OSs. \n\nIf you have permission to install new software, use `apt install` or `yum install` or `brew install`\nto install the Thrift compiler. (If you already have installed the thrift compiler, skip this step.)\nThen, you may add the following parameter\nwhen running Maven: `-Dthrift.download-url=http://apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt -Dthrift.exec.absolute.path=<YOUR LOCAL THRIFT BINARY FILE>`.\n\nIf not, then you have to compile the thrift compiler, and it requires you install a boost library first.\nTherefore, we compiled a Unix compiler ourselves and put it onto GitHub, and with the help of a\nmaven plugin, it will be downloaded automatically during compilation. \nThis compiler works fine with gcc8 or later, Ubuntu MacOS, and CentOS, but previous versions \nand other OSs are not guaranteed.\n\nIf you can not download the thrift compiler automatically because of a network problem, you can download \nit by yourself, and then either:\nrename your thrift file to `{project_root}\\thrift\\target\\tools\\thrift_0.12.0_0.13.0_linux.exe`;\nor, add Maven commands:\n`-Dthrift.download-url=http://apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt -Dthrift.exec.absolute.path=<YOUR LOCAL THRIFT BINARY FILE>`.\n\n### Compile IoTDB\n\nYou can download the source code from:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/apache/iotdb.git\n```\n\nThe default dev branch is the master branch, if you want to use a released version x.x.x:\n\n```\ngit checkout vx.x.x\n```\n\nOr checkout to the branch of a big version, e.g., the branch of 1.0 is rel/1.0.\n\n```\ngit checkout rel/x.x\n```\n\n### Build IoTDB from source\n\nUnder the root path of iotdb:\n\n```\n> mvn clean package -pl distribution -am -DskipTests\n```\n\nAfter being built, the IoTDB distribution is located at the folder: \"distribution/target\".\n\n\n### Only build cli\n\nUnder the iotdb/iotdb-client path:\n\n```\n> mvn clean package -pl cli -am -DskipTests\n```\n\nAfter being built, the IoTDB cli is located at the folder \"cli/target\".\n\n### Build Others\n\nUse `-P with-cpp` for compiling the cpp client. (For more details, read client-cpp's Readme file.)\n\n**NOTE: Directories \"`thrift/target/generated-sources/thrift`\", \"`thrift-sync/target/generated-sources/thrift`\",\n\"`thrift-cluster/target/generated-sources/thrift`\", \"`thrift-influxdb/target/generated-sources/thrift`\" \nand \"`antlr/target/generated-sources/antlr4`\" need to be added to sources roots to avoid compilation errors in the IDE.**\n\n**In IDEA, you just need to right click on the root project name and choose \"`Maven->Reload Project`\" after \nyou run `mvn package` successfully.**\n\n### Configurations\n\nConfiguration files are under the \"conf\" folder.\n\n  * environment config module (`datanode-env.bat`, `datanode-env.sh`),\n  * system config module (`iotdb-datanode.properties`)\n  * log config module (`logback.xml`).\n\nFor more information, please see [Config Manual](https://iotdb.apache.org/UserGuide/Master/Reference/DataNode-Config-Manual.html).\n\n## Start\n\nYou can go through the following steps to test the installation. If there is no error returned after execution, the installation is completed.\n\n### Start IoTDB\n\nUsers can start 1C1D IoTDB by the start-standalone script under the sbin folder.\n\n```\n# Unix/OS X\n> sbin/start-standalone.sh\n\n# Windows\n> sbin\\start-standalone.bat\n```\n\n### Use IoTDB\n\n#### Use Cli\n\nIoTDB offers different ways to interact with server, here we introduce the basic steps of using Cli tool to insert and query data.\n\nAfter installing IoTDB, there is a default user 'root', its default password is also 'root'. Users can use this\ndefault user to login Cli to use IoTDB. The start-up script of Cli is the start-cli script in the folder sbin. When executing the script, user should assign\nIP, PORT, USER_NAME and PASSWORD. The default parameters are \"-h 127.0.0.1 -p 6667 -u root -pw -root\".\n\nHere is the command for starting the Cli:\n\n```\n# Unix/OS X\n> sbin/start-cli.sh -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6667 -u root -pw root\n\n# Windows\n> sbin\\start-cli.bat -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6667 -u root -pw root\n```\n\nThe command line cli is interactive, so you should see the welcome logo and statements if everything is ready:\n\n```\n _____       _________  ______   ______\n|_   _|     |  _   _  ||_   _ `.|_   _ \\\n  | |   .--.|_/ | | \\_|  | | `. \\ | |_) |\n  | | / .'`\\ \\  | |      | |  | | |  __'.\n _| |_| \\__. | _| |_    _| |_.' /_| |__) |\n|_____|'.__.' |_____|  |______.'|_______/  version x.x.x\n\n\nIoTDB> login successfully\nIoTDB>\n```\n\n#### Basic commands for IoTDB\n\nNow, let us introduce the way of creating timeseries, inserting data and querying data.\n\nThe data in IoTDB is organized as timeseries. Each timeseries includes multiple data–time pairs, and is owned by a database. Before defining a timeseries, we should define a database using CREATE DATABASE first, and here is an example:\n\n```\nIoTDB> CREATE DATABASE root.ln\n```\n\nWe can also use SHOW DATABASES to check the database being created:\n\n```\nIoTDB> SHOW DATABASES\n+-------------+\n|     Database|\n+-------------+\n|      root.ln|\n+-------------+\nTotal line number = 1\n```\n\nAfter the database is set, we can use CREATE TIMESERIES to create a new timeseries. When creating a timeseries, we should define its data type and the encoding scheme. Here we create two timeseries:\n\n```\nIoTDB> CREATE TIMESERIES root.ln.wf01.wt01.status WITH DATATYPE=BOOLEAN, ENCODING=PLAIN\nIoTDB> CREATE TIMESERIES root.ln.wf01.wt01.temperature WITH DATATYPE=FLOAT, ENCODING=RLE\n```\n\nIn order to query the specific timeseries, we can use SHOW TIMESERIES <Path>. <Path> represent the location of the timeseries. The default value is \"null\", which queries all the timeseries in the system (the same as using \"SHOW TIMESERIES root\"). Here are some examples:\n\n1. Querying all timeseries in the system:\n\n```\nIoTDB> SHOW TIMESERIES\n+-----------------------------+-----+-------------+--------+--------+-----------+----+----------+\n|                   Timeseries|Alias|Database|DataType|Encoding|Compression|Tags|Attributes|\n+-----------------------------+-----+-------------+--------+--------+-----------+----+----------+\n|root.ln.wf01.wt01.temperature| null|      root.ln|   FLOAT|     RLE|     SNAPPY|null|      null|\n|     root.ln.wf01.wt01.status| null|      root.ln| BOOLEAN|   PLAIN|     SNAPPY|null|      null|\n+-----------------------------+-----+-------------+--------+--------+-----------+----+----------+\nTotal line number = 2\n```\n\n2. Querying a specific timeseries (root.ln.wf01.wt01.status):\n\n```\nIoTDB> SHOW TIMESERIES root.ln.wf01.wt01.status\n+------------------------+-----+-------------+--------+--------+-----------+----+----------+\n|              timeseries|alias|database|dataType|encoding|compression|tags|attributes|\n+------------------------+-----+-------------+--------+--------+-----------+----+----------+\n|root.ln.wf01.wt01.status| null|      root.ln| BOOLEAN|   PLAIN|     SNAPPY|null|      null|\n+------------------------+-----+-------------+--------+--------+-----------+----+----------+\nTotal line number = 1\n```\n\nInserting timeseries data is a basic operation of IoTDB, you can use the ‘INSERT’ command to finish this. Before insertion, you should assign the timestamp and the suffix path name:\n\n```\nIoTDB> INSERT INTO root.ln.wf01.wt01(timestamp,status) values(100,true);\nIoTDB> INSERT INTO root.ln.wf01.wt01(timestamp,status,temperature) values(200,false,20.71)\n```\n\nThe data that you have just inserted will be displayed as follows:\n\n```\nIoTDB> SELECT status FROM root.ln.wf01.wt01\n+------------------------+------------------------+\n|                    Time|root.ln.wf01.wt01.status|\n+------------------------+------------------------+\n|1970-01-01T00:00:00.100Z|                    true|\n|1970-01-01T00:00:00.200Z|                   false|\n+------------------------+------------------------+\nTotal line number = 2\n```\n\nYou can also query several timeseries data using one SQL statement:\n\n```\nIoTDB> SELECT * FROM root.ln.wf01.wt01\n+------------------------+-----------------------------+------------------------+\n|                    Time|root.ln.wf01.wt01.temperature|root.ln.wf01.wt01.status|\n+------------------------+-----------------------------+------------------------+\n|1970-01-01T00:00:00.100Z|                         null|                    true|\n|1970-01-01T00:00:00.200Z|                        20.71|                   false|\n+------------------------+-----------------------------+------------------------+\nTotal line number = 2\n```\n\nTo change the time zone in Cli, you can use the following SQL:\n\n```\nIoTDB> SET time_zone=+08:00\nTime zone has set to +08:00\nIoTDB> SHOW time_zone\nCurrent time zone: Asia/Shanghai\n```\n\nAdd then the query result will show using the new time zone.\n\n```\nIoTDB> SELECT * FROM root.ln.wf01.wt01\n+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+------------------------+\n|                         Time|root.ln.wf01.wt01.temperature|root.ln.wf01.wt01.status|\n+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+------------------------+\n|1970-01-01T08:00:00.100+08:00|                         null|                    true|\n|1970-01-01T08:00:00.200+08:00|                        20.71|                   false|\n+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+------------------------+\nTotal line number = 2\n```\n\nThe commands to exit the Cli are:\n\n```\nIoTDB> quit\nor\nIoTDB> exit\n```\n\nFor more information about the commands supported by IoTDB SQL, please see [User Guide](https://iotdb.apache.org/UserGuide/Master/QuickStart/QuickStart.html).\n\n### Stop IoTDB\n\nThe server can be stopped with \"ctrl-C\" or the following script:\n\n```\n# Unix/OS X\n> sbin/stop-standalone.sh\n\n# Windows\n> sbin\\stop-standalone.bat\n```\n\n# The use of CSV Import and Export Tool\n\nsee [The use of CSV Import and Export Tool](https://iotdb.apache.org/UserGuide/latest/Tools-System/Import-Export-Tool.html)\n\n# Frequent Questions for Compiling\nsee [Frequent Questions when Compiling the Source Code](https://iotdb.apache.org/Development/ContributeGuide.html#_Frequent-Questions-when-Compiling-the-Source-Code)\n\n# Contact Us\n\n### QQ Group\n\n* Apache IoTDB User Group: 659990460\n\n### Wechat Group\n\n* Add friend: `tietouqiao` or `liutaohua001`, and then we'll invite you to the group.\n\n### Slack\n\n* [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/apacheiotdb/shared_invite/zt-qvso1nj8-7715TpySZtZqmyG5qXQwpg)\n\nsee [Join the community](https://github.com/apache/iotdb/issues/1995) for more!\n",

As such, we are regretfully archiving the project to focus our attention on becoming a more deeply integrated service within the company. Unfortunately, we aren’t a large enough team to live in both the open-source world and the internal Microsoft world with its own unique set of requirements._**\n \n**_Our current plan is to archive the project in the next few months. That means we’ll still be making updates for a little while. Of course, even after it’s archived, you’ll still be able to fork it and make the changes you need. Once we’ve decided on a specific date for archiving, we’ll update this readme._**\n \n**_Thanks for taking the journey with us._**\n\n**_The OneFuzz team._**\n\n---\n**_Update: September 15 2023:_**\n**_Our current target to archive the project is September 30th, 2023._**\n\n---\n\n[![Onefuzz build status](https://github.com/microsoft/onefuzz/workflows/Build/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/microsoft/onefuzz/actions/workflows/ci.yml?query=branch%3Amain)\n\n## A self-hosted Fuzzing-As-A-Service platform\n\nProject OneFuzz enables continuous developer-driven fuzzing to proactively\nharden software prior to release.  With a [single \ncommand](docs/getting-started.md#launching-a-job), which can be [baked into\nCICD](contrib/onefuzz-job-github-actions/README.md), developers can launch\nfuzz jobs from a few virtual machines to thousands of cores.\n\n## Features\n\n* **Composable fuzzing workflows**: Open source allows users to onboard their own \n   fuzzers, [swap instrumentation](docs/custom-analysis.md), and manage seed inputs. \n* **Built-in ensemble fuzzing**: By default, fuzzers work as a team to share strengths, \n   swapping inputs of interest between fuzzing technologies.\n* **Programmatic triage and result de-duplication**: It provides unique flaw cases that \n   always reproduce.\n* **On-demand live-debugging of found crashes**: It lets you summon a live debugging\n   session on-demand or from your build system.\n* **Observable and Debug-able**: Transparent design allows introspection into every \n   stage.\n* **Fuzz on Windows and Linux**: Multi-platform by design. Fuzz using your own [OS \n   build](docs/custom-images.md), kernel, or nested hypervisor.\n* **Crash reporting notification callbacks**: Including [Azure DevOps Work\n   Items](docs/notifications/ado.md) and [Microsoft Teams\n   messages](docs/notifications/teams.md)\n\nFor information, check out some of our guides:\n* [Terminology](docs/terminology.md)\n* [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md)\n* [Supported Platforms](docs/supported-platforms.md)\n* [More documentation](docs)\n\nAre you a Microsoft employee interested in fuzzing?

        "README_content": "## [Gitoxide](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide): A peek into the future…\n\nI started working on GitPython in 2009, back in the days when Python was 'my thing' and I had great plans with it.\nOf course, back in the days, I didn't really know what I was doing and this shows in many places. Somewhat similar to\nPython this happens to be 'good enough', but at the same time is deeply flawed and broken beyond repair.\n\nBy now, GitPython is widely used and I am sure there is a good reason for that, it's something to be proud of and happy about.\nThe community is maintaining the software and is keeping it relevant for which I am absolutely grateful. For the time to come I am happy to continue maintaining GitPython, remaining hopeful that one day it won't be needed anymore.\n\nMore than 15 years after my first meeting with 'git' I am still in excited about it, and am happy to finally have the tools and\nprobably the skills to scratch that itch of mine: implement `git` in a way that makes tool creation a piece of cake for most.\n\nIf you like the idea and want to learn more, please head over to [gitoxide](https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide), an\nimplementation of 'git' in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).\n\n## GitPython\n\nGitPython is a python library used to interact with git repositories, high-level like git-porcelain,\nor low-level like git-plumbing.\n\nIt provides abstractions of git objects for easy access of repository data, and additionally\nallows you to access the git repository more directly using either a pure python implementation,\nor the faster, but more resource intensive *git command* implementation.\n\nThe object database implementation is optimized for handling large quantities of objects and large datasets,\nwhich is achieved by using low-level structures and data streaming.\n\n\n### REQUIREMENTS\n\nGitPython needs the `git` executable to be installed on the system and available\nin your `PATH` for most operations.\nIf it is not in your `PATH`, you can help GitPython find it by setting\nthe `GIT_PYTHON_GIT_EXECUTABLE=<path/to/git>` environment variable.\n\n* Git (1.7.x or newer)\n* Python >= 3.5\n\nThe list of dependencies are listed in `./requirements.txt` and `./test-requirements.txt`.\nThe installer takes care of installing them for you.\n\n### INSTALL\n\nIf you have downloaded the source code:\n\n    python setup.py install\n\nor if you want to obtain a copy from the Pypi repository:\n\n    pip install GitPython\n\nBoth commands will install the required package dependencies.\n\nA distribution package can be obtained for manual installation at:\n\n    http://pypi.python.org/pypi/GitPython\n\nIf you like to clone from source, you can do it like so:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\n./init-tests-after-clone.sh\n```\n\n### Limitations\n\n#### Leakage of System Resources\n\nGitPython is not suited for long-running processes (like daemons) as it tends to\nleak system resources. It was written in a time where destructors (as implemented\nin the `__del__` method) still ran deterministically.\n\nIn case you still want to use it in such a context, you will want to search the\ncodebase for `__del__` implementations and call these yourself when you see fit.\n\nAnother way assure proper cleanup of resources is to factor out GitPython into a\nseparate process which can be dropped periodically.\n\n#### Windows support\n\nSee [Issue #525](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/issues/525).\n\n### RUNNING TESTS\n\n*Important*: Right after cloning this repository, please be sure to have executed\nthe `./init-tests-after-clone.sh` script in the repository root. Otherwise\nyou will encounter test failures.\n\nOn *Windows*, make sure you have `git-daemon` in your PATH.  For MINGW-git, the `git-daemon.exe`\nexists in `Git\\mingw64\\libexec\\git-core\\`; CYGWIN has no daemon, but should get along fine\nwith MINGW's.\n\nThe easiest way to run tests is by using [tox](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tox)\na wrapper around virtualenv. It will take care of setting up environments with the proper\ndependencies installed and execute test commands. To install it simply:\n\n    pip install tox\n\nThen run:\n\n    tox\n\n\nFor more fine-grained control, you can use `unittest`.\n\n### Contributions\n\nPlease have a look at the [contributions file][contributing].\n\n### INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n* [User Documentation](http://gitpython.readthedocs.org)\n* [Questions and Answers](http://stackexchange.com/filters/167317/gitpython)\n * Please post on stackoverflow and use the `gitpython` tag\n* [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/issues)\n  * Post reproducible bugs and feature requests as a new issue.\n    Please be sure to provide the following information if posting bugs:\n    * GitPython version (e.g. `import git; git.__version__`)\n    * Python version (e.g. `python --version`)\n    * The encountered stack-trace, if applicable\n    * Enough information to allow reproducing the issue\n\n### How to make a new release\n\n* Update/verify the **version** in the `VERSION` file\n* Update/verify that the `doc/source/changes.rst` changelog file was updated\n* Commit everything\n* Run `git tag -s <version>` to tag the version in Git\n* Run `make release`\n* Close the milestone mentioned in the _changelog_ and create a new one. _Do not reuse milestones by renaming them_.\n* set the upcoming version in the `VERSION` file, usually be\n  incrementing the patch level, and possibly by appending `-dev`. Probably you\n  want to `git push` once more.\n\n### How to verify a release\n\nPlease only use releases from `pypi` as you can verify the respective source\ntarballs.\n\nThis script shows how to verify the tarball was indeed created by the authors of\nthis project:\n\n```\ncurl https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/09/bc/ae32e07e89cc25b9e5c793d19a1e5454d30a8e37d95040991160f942519e/GitPython-3.1.8-py3-none-any.whl > gitpython.whl\ncurl https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/09/bc/ae32e07e89cc25b9e5c793d19a1e5454d30a8e37d95040991160f942519e/GitPython-3.1.8-py3-none-any.whl.asc >  gitpython-signature.asc\ngpg --verify gitpython-signature.asc gitpython.whl\n```\n\nwhich outputs\n\n```\ngpg: Signature made Fr  4 Sep 10:04:50 2020 CST\ngpg:                using RSA key 27C50E7F590947D7273A741E85194C08421980C9\ngpg: Good signature from \"Sebastian Thiel (YubiKey USB-C) <byronimo@gmail.com>\" [ultimate]\ngpg:                 aka \"Sebastian Thiel (In Rust I trust) <sebastian.thiel@icloud.com>\" [ultimate]\n```\n\nYou can verify that the keyid indeed matches the release-signature key provided in this\nrepository by looking at the keys details:\n\n```\ngpg --list-packets ./release-verification-key.asc\n```\n\nYou can verify that the commit adding it was also signed by it using:\n\n```\ngit show --show-signature  ./release-verification-key.asc\n```\n\nIf you would like to trust it permanently, you can import and sign it:\n\n```\ngpg --import ./release-verification-key.asc\ngpg --edit-key 4C08421980C9\n\n> sign\n> save\n```\n\n### Projects using GitPython\n\n* [PyDriller](https://github.com/ishepard/pydriller)\n* [Kivy Designer](https://github.com/kivy/kivy-designer)\n* [Prowl](https://github.com/nettitude/Prowl)\n* [Python Taint](https://github.com/python-security/pyt)\n* [Buster](https://github.com/axitkhurana/buster)\n* [git-ftp](https://github.com/ezyang/git-ftp)\n* [Git-Pandas](https://github.com/wdm0006/git-pandas)\n* [PyGitUp](https://github.com/msiemens/PyGitUp)\n* [PyJFuzz](https://github.com/mseclab/PyJFuzz)\n* [Loki](https://github.com/Neo23x0/Loki)\n* [Omniwallet](https://github.com/OmniLayer/omniwallet)\n* [GitViper](https://github.com/BeayemX/GitViper)\n* [Git Gud](https://github.com/bthayer2365/git-gud)\n\n### LICENSE\n\nNew BSD License.

Please visit `OMERO Python language bindings <https://omero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/developers/Python.html>`_ for a list of supported platforms and Python versions.\n\nWhen the wheel is installed, activate the virtual environment and install ``omero-web`` from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/>`_.\n\n::\n\n    $  pip install -U omero-web\n\nSetting of the environment variable ``OMERODIR`` is required.\n``$OMERODIR/var/log/`` directory will contain log files.\n``$OMERODIR/etc/grid/config.xml`` is used to store config::\n\n    $ export OMERODIR=$(pwd)\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nFor running omero-web in production with NGINX, see See: `OMERO.web install`_ documentation.\nTo run in development mode, see below.\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nSee: `OMERO`_ documentation\n\nDeveloper installation\n----------------------\n\nFor a development installation we recommend creating a virtual environment as described above.\nThen install OMERO.web into your virtual environment as an editable package, so that any edits\nto source files will be reflected in your installation.\n\n::\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/ome/omero-web\n    $ cd omero-web\n    $ pip install -e .\n\nNote some ``omero-web`` tests may not run when this module and/or ``omero-py`` are installed in editable mode.\n\nConfiguration for developer usage::\n\n    $ omero config set omero.web.debug True\n    $ omero config set omero.web.application_server development\n\n    # If you want to connect to OMERO.server other than 'localhost'\n    $ omero config append omero.web.server_list '[\"demo.openmicroscopy.org\", 4064, \"demo\"]'\n\nThen run omero-web in the foreground with::\n\n    $ omero web start\n    ...\n    Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:4080/\n\nOr, run Django directly::\n\n    $ cd omero-web\n    $ python omeroweb/manage.py runserver 4080\n    ...\n    Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:4080/\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n\nPlugin developers should review the `Upgrading <UPGRADING.md>`_\ndocument highlighting steps that may need to be taken\nwhen upgrading OMERO.web to ensure plugins or other customizations\ncontinue to function as expected.\n\nRunning tests\n-------------\n\nUnit tests are located under the `test` directory and can be run with pytest.\n\nIntegration tests\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nIntegration tests are stored in the main repository (ome/openmicroscopy) and depend on the\nOMERO integration testing framework. Reading about `Running and writing tests`_ in the `OMERO`_ documentation\nis essential.\n\nRelease process\n---------------\n\nThis repository uses `bump2version <https://pypi.org/project/bump2version/>`_ to manage version numbers.\nTo tag a release run::\n\n    $ bumpversion release\n\nThis will remove the ``.dev0`` suffix from the current version, commit, and tag the release.\n\nTo switch back to a development version run::\n\n    $ bumpversion --no-tag patch\n\nNB: this assumes next release will be a ``patch`` (see below).\nTo complete the release, push the master branch and the release tag to origin::\n\n    $ git push origin master v5.8.0\n\nIf any PRs are merged that would require the next release to be a ``major`` or ``minor`` version\n(see `semver.org <https://semver.org/>`_) then that PR can include a version bump created via::\n\n    $ bumpversion --no-tag minor|major\n\nIf this hasn't been performed prior to release and you wish to specify the next version\nnumber directly when creating the release, this can be achieved with::\n\n    $ bumpversion --new-version 5.9.0 release\n\nomero-web-docker\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nFollowing ``omero-web`` release, need to update and release ``omero-web-docker``.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nOMERO.web is released under the AGPL.\n\nCopyright\n---------\n\n2009-2024, The Open Microscopy Environment, Glencoe Software, Inc.\n\n.. _OMERO: https://www.openmicroscopy.org/omero\n.. _OMERO.web install: https://omero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sysadmins/unix/install-web/web-deployment.html\n.. _OMERO.py: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/omero-py\n.. _ZeroC IcePy: https://zeroc.com/downloads/ice/3.6\n.. _Pillow: https://python-pillow.org/\n.. _NumPy: http://matplotlib.org/\n.. _Running and writing tests: https://omero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/omero/developers/testing.html\n",
