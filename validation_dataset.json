LGPLv3 License\n\nLearn more at http://web2py.com\n\n## Google App Engine deployment\n\n    cp examples/app.yaml ./\n    cp handlers/gaehandler.py ./\n\nThen edit ./app.yaml and replace \"yourappname\" with yourappname.\n\n## Important reminder about this GIT repo\n\nAn important part of web2py is the Database Abstraction Layer (DAL). In early 2015 this was decoupled into a separate code-base ([PyDAL](https://github.com/web2py/pydal)). In terms of git, it is a sub-module of the main repository.\n\nThe use of a sub-module requires a one-time use of the --recursive flag for git clone if you are cloning web2py from scratch.\n\n    git clone --recursive https://github.com/web2py/web2py.git\n\nIf you have an existing repository, the commands below need to be executed at least once:\n\n    git submodule update --init --recursive\n\nPyDAL uses a separate stable release cycle to the rest of web2py. PyDAL releases will use a date-naming scheme similar to Ubuntu. Issues related to PyDAL should be reported to its separate repository.\n\n\n## Documentation (readthedocs.org)\n\n[![Docs Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/web2py/badge/?version=latest&style=flat-square)](http://web2py.rtfd.org/)\n\n## Tests\n\n[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/web2py/web2py/master.svg?style=flat-square&label=Travis-CI)](https://app.travis-ci.com/github/web2py/web2py)\n[![MS Build Status](https://img.shields.io/appveyor/ci/web2py/web2py/master.svg?style=flat-square&label=Appveyor-CI)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/web2py/web2py)\n[![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/web2py/web2py.svg?style=flat-square)](https://codecov.io/github/web2py/web2py)\n\n\n## Installation Instructions\n\nTo start web2py there is NO NEED to install it.

Archivy is also easily integrated with other services and your online accounts.\n- Knowledge base organization with bidirectional links between notes, and embedded tags.\n- Everything is a file! For ease of access and editing, all the content is stored in extended markdown files with yaml front matter. This format supports footnotes, LaTeX math rendering, syntax highlighting and more. \n- Extensible plugin system and API for power users to take control of their knowledge process\n- [syncing options](https://github.com/archivy/archivy-git)\n- Powerful and advanced search. \n- Image upload\n\n\n[demo video](https://www.uzpg.me/assets/images/archivy.mov)\n\n[Roadmap](https://github.com/archivy/archivy/issues/74#issuecomment-764828063)\n\nUpcoming:\n\n- Annotations\n- Multi User System with permission setup.\n\n## Quickstart\n\n\nInstall archivy with `pip install archivy`. Other installations methods are listed [here](https://archivy.github.io/install), including Docker.\n\nRun the `archivy init` command to setup you installation.\n\nThen run this and enter a password to create a new user:\n\n```bash\n$ archivy create-admin <username>\n```\n\nFinally, execute `archivy run` to serve the app. You can open it at https://localhost:5000 and login with the credentials you entered before.\n\nYou can then use archivy to create notes, bookmarks and then organize and store information.\n\nSee the [official docs](https://archivy.github.io) for information on other installation methods.\n\n## Community\n\nArchivy is dedicated to building **open and quality knowledge base software** through collaboration and community discussion.\n\nTo get news and updates on Archivy and its development, you can [watch the archivy repository](https://github.com/archivy/archivy) or follow [@uzpg_ on Twitter](https://twitter.com/uzpg_).\n\nYou can interact with us through the [issue board](https://github.com/archivy/archivy/issues) and the more casual [discord server](https://discord.gg/uQsqyxB).\n\nNote: If you're interested in the applications of AI to knowledge management, we're also working on this with [Espial](https://github.com/Uzay-G/espial).\n",

        "README_content": "# [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) — New Wave JavaScript\n\nMeetings are currently held on the [matrix.org platform](https://matrix.to/#/#jquery_meeting:gitter.im).\n\nMeeting minutes can be found at [meetings.jquery.org](https://meetings.jquery.org/category/core/).\n\nThe latest version of jQuery is available at [https://jquery.com/download/](https://jquery.com/download/).\n\n## Version support\n\n| Version | Branch     | Status   |\n| ------- | ---------- | -------- |\n| 4.x     | main       | Beta     |\n| 3.x     | 3.x-stable | Active   |\n| 2.x     | 2.x-stable | Inactive |\n| 1.x     | 1.x-stable | Inactive |\n\nOnce 4.0.0 final is released, the 3.x branch will continue to receive updates for a limited time. The 2.x and 1.x branches are no longer supported.\n\nCommercial support for inactive versions is available from [HeroDevs](https://herodevs.com/nes).\n\nLearn more about our [version support](https://jquery.com/support/).\n\n## Contribution Guides\n\nIn the spirit of open source software development, jQuery always encourages community code contribution. To help you get started and before you jump into writing code, be sure to read these important contribution guidelines thoroughly:\n\n1. [Getting Involved](https://contribute.jquery.org/)\n2. [Core Style Guide](https://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/)\n3. [Writing Code for jQuery Projects](https://contribute.jquery.org/code/)\n\n### References to issues/PRs\n\nGitHub issues/PRs are usually referenced via `gh-NUMBER`, where `NUMBER` is the numerical ID of the issue/PR. You can find such an issue/PR under `https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/NUMBER`.\n\njQuery has used a different bug tracker - based on Trac - in the past, available under [bugs.jquery.com](https://bugs.jquery.com/). It is being kept in read only mode so that referring to past discussions is possible. When jQuery source references one of those issues, it uses the pattern `trac-NUMBER`, where `NUMBER` is the numerical ID of the issue. You can find such an issue under `https://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/NUMBER`.\n\n## Environments in which to use jQuery\n\n- [Browser support](https://jquery.com/browser-support/)\n- jQuery also supports Node, browser extensions, and other non-browser environments.\n\n## What you need to build your own jQuery\n\nTo build jQuery, you need to have the latest Node.js/npm and git 1.7 or later. Earlier versions might work, but are not supported.\n\nFor Windows, you have to download and install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).\n\nmacOS users should install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Once Homebrew is installed, run `brew install git` to install git,\nand `brew install node` to install Node.js.\n\nLinux/BSD users should use their appropriate package managers to install git and Node.js, or build from source\nif you swing that way. Easy-peasy.\n\n## How to build your own jQuery\n\nFirst, [clone the jQuery git repo](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).\n\nThen, enter the jquery directory, install dependencies, and run the build script:\n\n```bash\ncd jquery\nnpm install\nnpm run build\n```\n\nThe built version of jQuery will be placed in the `dist/` directory, along with a minified copy and associated map file.\n\n## Build all jQuery release files\n\nTo build all variants of jQuery, run the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build:all\n```\n\nThis will create all of the variants that jQuery includes in a release, including `jquery.js`, `jquery.slim.js`, `jquery.module.js`, and `jquery.slim.module.js` along their associated minified files and sourcemaps.\n\n`jquery.module.js` and `jquery.slim.module.js` are [ECMAScript modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) that export `jQuery` and `$` as named exports are placed in the `dist-module/` directory rather than the `dist/` directory.\n\n## Building a Custom jQuery\n\nThe build script can be used to create a custom version of jQuery that includes only the modules you need.\n\nAny module may be excluded except for `core`. When excluding `selector`, it is not removed but replaced with a small wrapper around native `querySelectorAll` (see below for more information).\n\n### Build Script Help\n\nTo see the full list of available options for the build script, run the following:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build -- --help\n```\n\n### Modules\n\nTo exclude a module, pass its path relative to the `src` folder (without the `.js` extension) to the `--exclude` option. When using the `--include` option, the default includes are dropped and a build is created with only those modules.\n\nSome example modules that can be excluded or included are:\n\n- **ajax**: All AJAX functionality: `$.ajax()`, `$.get()`, `$.post()`, `$.ajaxSetup()`, `.load()`, transports, and ajax event shorthands such as `.ajaxStart()`.\n- **ajax/xhr**: The XMLHTTPRequest AJAX transport only.\n- **ajax/script**: The `<script>` AJAX transport only; used to retrieve scripts.\n- **ajax/jsonp**: The JSONP AJAX transport only; depends on the ajax/script transport.\n- **css**: The `.css()` method. Also removes **all** modules depending on css (including **effects**, **dimensions**, and **offset**).\n- **css/showHide**: Non-animated `.show()`, `.hide()` and `.toggle()`; can be excluded if you use classes or explicit `.css()` calls to set the `display` property. Also removes the **effects** module.\n- **deprecated**: Methods documented as deprecated but not yet removed.\n- **dimensions**: The `.width()` and `.height()` methods, including `inner-` and `outer-` variations.\n- **effects**: The `.animate()` method and its shorthands such as `.slideUp()` or `.hide(\"slow\")`.\n- **event**: The `.on()` and `.off()` methods and all event functionality.\n- **event/trigger**: The `.trigger()` and `.triggerHandler()` methods.\n- **offset**: The `.offset()`, `.position()`, `.offsetParent()`, `.scrollLeft()`, and `.scrollTop()` methods.\n- **wrap**: The `.wrap()`, `.wrapAll()`, `.wrapInner()`, and `.unwrap()` methods.\n- **core/ready**: Exclude the ready module if you place your scripts at the end of the body. Any ready callbacks bound with `jQuery()` will simply be called immediately. However, `jQuery(document).ready()` will not be a function and `.on(\"ready\", ...)` or similar will not be triggered.\n- **deferred**: Exclude jQuery.Deferred. This also excludes all modules that rely on Deferred, including **ajax**, **effects**, and **queue**, but replaces **core/ready** with **core/ready-no-deferred**.\n- **exports/global**: Exclude the attachment of global jQuery variables ($ and jQuery) to the window.\n- **exports/amd**: Exclude the AMD definition.\n\n- **selector**: The full jQuery selector engine. When this module is excluded, it is replaced with a rudimentary selector engine based on the browser's `querySelectorAll` method that does not support jQuery selector extensions or enhanced semantics. See the [selector-native.js](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/main/src/selector-native.js) file for details.\n\n*Note*: Excluding the full `selector` module will also exclude all jQuery selector extensions (such as `effects/animatedSelector` and `css/hiddenVisibleSelectors`).\n\n##### AMD name\n\nYou can set the module name for jQuery's AMD definition. By default, it is set to \"jquery\", which plays nicely with plugins and third-party libraries, but there may be cases where you'd like to change this. Pass it to the `--amd` parameter:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build -- --amd=\"custom-name\"\n```\n\nOr, to define anonymously, leave the name blank.\n\n```bash\nnpm run build -- --amd\n```\n\n##### File name and directory\n\nThe default name for the built jQuery file is `jquery.js`; it is placed under the `dist/` directory. It's possible to change the file name using `--filename` and the directory using `--dir`. `--dir` is relative to the project root.\n\n```bash\nnpm run build -- --slim --filename=\"jquery.slim.js\" --dir=\"/tmp\"\n```\n\nThis would create a slim version of jQuery and place it under `tmp/jquery.slim.js`.\n\n##### ECMAScript Module (ESM) mode\n\nBy default, jQuery generates a regular script JavaScript file. You can also generate an ECMAScript module exporting `jQuery` as the default export using the `--esm` parameter:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build -- --filename=jquery.module.js --esm\n```\n\n##### Factory mode\n\nBy default, jQuery depends on a global `window`. For environments that don't have one, you can generate a factory build that exposes a function accepting `window` as a parameter that you can provide externally (see [`README` of the published package](build/fixtures/README.md) for usage instructions). You can generate such a factory using the `--factory` parameter:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build -- --filename=jquery.factory.js --factory\n```\n\nThis option can be mixed with others like `--esm` or `--slim`:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build -- --filename=jquery.factory.slim.module.js --factory --esm --slim --dir=\"/dist-module\"\n```\n\n#### Custom Build Examples\n\nCreate a custom build using `npm run build`, listing the modules to be excluded. Excluding a top-level module also excludes its corresponding directory of modules.\n\nExclude all **ajax** functionality:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build -- --exclude=ajax\n```\n\nExcluding **css** removes modules depending on CSS: **effects**, **offset**, **dimensions**.\n\n```bash\nnpm run build -- --exclude=css\n```\n\nExclude a bunch of modules (`-e` is an alias for `--exclude`):\n\n```bash\nnpm run build -- -e ajax/jsonp -e css -e deprecated -e dimensions -e effects -e offset -e wrap\n```\n\nThere is a special alias to generate a build with the same configuration as the official jQuery Slim build:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build -- --filename=jquery.slim.js --slim\n```\n\nOr, to create the slim build as an esm module:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build -- --filename=jquery.slim.module.js --slim --esm\n```\n\n*Non-official custom builds are not regularly tested. Use them at your own risk.*\n\n## Running the Unit Tests\n\nMake sure you have the necessary dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\n\nStart `npm start` to auto-build jQuery as you work:\n\n```bash\nnpm start\n```\n\nRun the unit tests with a local server that supports PHP. Ensure that you run the site from the root directory, not the \"test\" directory. No database is required. Pre-configured php local servers are available for Windows and Mac. Here are some options:\n\n- Windows: [WAMP download](https://www.wampserver.com/en/)\n- Mac: [MAMP download](https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/)\n- Linux: [Setting up LAMP](https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/easy-lamp-server-installation/)\n- [Mongoose (most platforms)](https://code.google.com/p/mongoose/)\n\n## Essential Git\n\nAs the source code is handled by the Git version control system, it's useful to know some features used.\n\n### Cleaning\n\nIf you want to purge your working directory back to the status of upstream, the following commands can be used (remember everything you've worked on is gone after these):\n\n```bash\ngit reset --hard upstream/main\ngit clean -fdx\n```\n\n### Rebasing\n\nFor feature/topic branches, you should always use the `--rebase` flag to `git pull`, or if you are usually handling many temporary \"to be in a github pull request\" branches, run the following to automate this:\n\n```bash\ngit config branch.autosetuprebase local\n```\n\n(see `man git-config` for more information)\n\n### Handling merge conflicts\n\nIf you're getting merge conflicts when merging, instead of editing the conflicted files manually, you can use the feature\n`git mergetool`. Even though the default tool `xxdiff` looks awful/old, it's rather useful.\n\nThe following are some commands that can be used there:\n\n- `Ctrl + Alt + M` - automerge as much as possible\n- `b` - jump to next merge conflict\n- `s` - change the order of the conflicted lines\n- `u` - undo a merge\n- `left mouse button` - mark a block to be the winner\n- `middle mouse button` - mark a line to be the winner\n- `Ctrl + S` - save\n- `Ctrl + Q` - quit\n\n## [QUnit](https://api.qunitjs.com) Reference\n\n### Test methods\n\n```js\nexpect( numAssertions );\nstop();\nstart();\n```\n\n*Note*: QUnit's eventual addition of an argument to stop/start is ignored in this test suite so that start and stop can be passed as callbacks without worrying about their parameters.\n\n### Test assertions\n\n```js\nok( value, [message] );\nequal( actual, expected, [message] );\nnotEqual( actual, expected, [message] );\ndeepEqual( actual, expected, [message] );\nnotDeepEqual( actual, expected, [message] );\nstrictEqual( actual, expected, [message] );\nnotStrictEqual( actual, expected, [message] );\nthrows( block, [expected], [message] );\n```\n\n## Test Suite Convenience Methods Reference\n\nSee [test/data/testinit.js](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/main/test/data/testinit.js).\n\n### Returns an array of elements with the given IDs\n\n```js\nq( ... );\n```\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nq( \"main\", \"foo\", \"bar\" );\n\n=> [ div#main, span#foo, input#bar ]\n```\n\n### Asserts that a selection matches the given IDs\n\n```js\nt( testName, selector, [ \"array\", \"of\", \"ids\" ] );\n```\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nt(\"Check for something\", \"//[a]\", [\"foo\", \"bar\"]);\n```\n\n### Fires a native DOM event without going through jQuery\n\n```js\nfireNative( node, eventType );\n```\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nfireNative( jQuery( \"#elem\" )[ 0 ], \"click\" );\n```\n\n### Add random number to url to stop caching\n\n```js\nurl( \"some/url\" );\n```\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nurl( \"index.html\" );\n\n=> \"data/index.html?10538358428943\"\n\n\nurl( \"mock.php?foo=bar\" );\n\n=> \"data/mock.php?foo=bar&10538358345554\"\n```\n\n### Run tests in an iframe\n\nSome tests may require a document other than the standard test fixture, and\nthese can be run in a separate iframe. The actual test code and assertions\nremain in jQuery's main test files; only the minimal test fixture markup\nand setup code should be placed in the iframe file.\n\n```js\ntestIframe( testName, fileName,\n  function testCallback(\n      assert, jQuery, window, document,\n\t  [ additional args ] ) {\n\t...\n  } );\n```\n\nThis loads a page, constructing a url with fileName `\"./data/\" + fileName`.\nThe iframed page determines when the callback occurs in the test by\nincluding the \"/test/data/iframeTest.js\" script and calling\n`startIframeTest( [ additional args ] )` when appropriate. Often this\nwill be after either document ready or `window.onload` fires.\n\nThe `testCallback` receives the QUnit `assert` object created by `testIframe`\nfor this test, followed by the global `jQuery`, `window`, and `document` from\nthe iframe. If the iframe code passes any arguments to `startIframeTest`,\nthey follow the `document` argument.\n\n## Questions?\n\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to ask on the\n[Developing jQuery Core forum](https://forum.jquery.com/developing-jquery-core) or in #jquery on [libera](https://web.libera.chat/).\n",

We do not support Windows at this time, but many users [report success on Windows using Python 3.8](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/issues/3989) and issues with Python 3.9. We are happy to accept patches that improve Windows support.\n\n### Python Interpreter\n\nParlAI currently requires Python3.8+.\n\n### Requirements\n\nParlAI supports [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org) 1.6 or higher.\nAll requirements of the core modules are listed in [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/blob/main/requirements.txt). However, some models included (in [`parlai/agents`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/tree/main/parlai/agents)) have additional requirements.\n\n## Virtual Environment\n\nWe *strongly* recommend you install ParlAI in a virtual environment using [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) or [conda](https://www.anaconda.com/).\n\n### End User Installation\n\nIf you want to use ParlAI without modifications, you can install it with:\n\n```bash\ncd /path/to/your/parlai-app\npython3.8 -m venv venv\nvenv/bin/pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel\nvenv/bin/pip install parlai\n```\n\n### Developer Installation\n\nMany users will want to modify some parts of ParlAI. To set up a development\nenvironment, run the following commands to clone the repository and install\nParlAI:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI.git ~/ParlAI\ncd ~/ParlAI\npython3.8 -m venv venv\nvenv/bin/pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel\nvenv/bin/python setup.py develop\n```\n\n> **Note**\n> Sometimes the install from source maynot work due to dependencies (specially in PyTorch related packaged).\n> In that case try building a fresh conda environment and running the similar to the following:\n> `conda install pytorch==2.0.0 torchvision torchaudio torchtext pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia`.\n> Check torch setup documentation for your CUDA and OS versions.\n\nAll needed data will be downloaded to `~/ParlAI/data`. If you need to clear out\nthe space used by these files, you can safely delete these directories and any\nfiles needed will be downloaded again.\n\n## Documentation\n\n - [Quick Start](https://parl.ai/docs/tutorial_quick.html)\n - [Basics: world, agents, teachers, action and observations](https://parl.ai/docs/tutorial_basic.html)\n - [Creating a new dataset/task](http://parl.ai/docs/tutorial_task.html)\n - [List of available tasks/datasets](https://parl.ai/docs/tasks.html)\n - [Creating a seq2seq agent](https://parl.ai/docs/tutorial_torch_generator_agent.html)\n - [List of available agents](https://parl.ai/docs/agents_list.html)\n - [Model zoo (list pretrained models)](https://parl.ai/docs/zoo.html)\n - [Running crowdsourcing tasks](http://parl.ai/docs/tutorial_crowdsourcing.html)\n - [Plug into Facebook Messenger](https://parl.ai/docs/tutorial_chat_service.html)\n\n\n## Examples\n\nA large set of scripts can be found in [`parlai/scripts`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/tree/main/parlai/scripts). Here are a few of them.\nNote: If any of these examples fail, check the [installation section](#installing-parlai) to see if you have missed something.\n\nDisplay 10 random examples from the SQuAD task\n```bash\nparlai display_data -t squad\n```\n\nEvaluate an IR baseline model on the validation set of the Personachat task:\n```bash\nparlai eval_model -m ir_baseline -t personachat -dt valid\n```\n\nTrain a single layer transformer on PersonaChat (requires pytorch and torchtext).\nDetail: embedding size 300, 4 attention heads,  2 epochs using batchsize 64, word vectors are initialized with fasttext and the other elements of the batch are used as negative during training.\n```bash\nparlai train_model -t personachat -m transformer/ranker -mf /tmp/model_tr6 --n-layers 1 --embedding-size 300 --ffn-size 600 --n-heads 4 --num-epochs 2 -veps 0.25 -bs 64 -lr 0.001 --dropout 0.1 --embedding-type fasttext_cc --candidates batch\n```\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe code is set up into several main directories:\n\n- [**core**](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/tree/main/parlai/core): contains the primary code for the framework\n- [**agents**](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/tree/main/parlai/agents): contains agents which can interact with the different tasks (e.g. machine learning models)\n- [**scripts**](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/tree/main/parlai/scripts): contains a number of useful scripts, like training, evaluating, interactive chatting, ...\n- [**tasks**](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/tree/main/parlai/tasks): contains code for the different tasks available from within ParlAI\n- [**mturk**](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/tree/main/parlai/mturk): contains code for setting up Mechanical Turk, as well as sample MTurk tasks\n- [**messenger**](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/tree/main/parlai/chat_service/services/messenger): contains code for interfacing with Facebook Messenger\n- [**utils**](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/tree/main/parlai/utils): contains a wide number of frequently used utility methods\n- [**crowdsourcing**](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/tree/main/parlai/crowdsourcing): contains code for running crowdsourcing tasks, such as on Amazon Mechanical Turk\n- [**chat_service**](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/tree/main/parlai/chat_service/services/messenger): contains code for interfacing with services such as Facebook Messenger\n- [**zoo**](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/tree/main/parlai/zoo): contains code to directly download and use pretrained models from our model zoo\n\n## Support\nIf you have any questions, bug reports or feature requests, please don't hesitate to post on our [Github Issues page](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/issues).\nYou may also be interested in checking out our [FAQ](https://parl.ai/docs/faq.html) and\nour [Tips n Tricks](https://parl.ai/docs/tutorial_tipsntricks.html).\n\nPlease remember to follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n## Contributing\nWe welcome PRs from the community!\n\nYou can find information about contributing to ParlAI in our\n[Contributing](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\ndocument.\n\n\n## The Team\nParlAI is currently maintained by Moya Chen, Emily Dinan, Dexter Ju, Mojtaba\nKomeili, Spencer Poff, Pratik Ringshia, Stephen Roller, Kurt Shuster,\nEric Michael Smith, Megan Ung, Jack Urbanek, Jason Weston, Mary Williamson,\nand Jing Xu.

These steps are written to an output file\n(Compilation Database) in a JSON format.\n- *Step 2*: `CodeChecker analyze` uses the previously created JSON Compilation\nDatabase to perform an analysis on the project, outputting analysis results in\na machine-readable (plist) format.\n- *Step 3*: In this step, you can do multiple things:\n    - Parse and pretty-print the summary and results from analysis result files\n    (`CodeChecker parse`).\n    - Store the results to a running CodeChecker server (`CodeChecker store`).\n    - Compare two analysis results/runs to show the results that differ between\n    the two (`CodeChecker cmd diff`).\n    - etc.\n\nFor more information how to use CodeChecker see our [user guide](usage.md).\n\n# User documentation\n\n* [Getting started (How-To

files)](/docs/tools/tu_collector.md)\n* [Report Hash generator (to generate unique hash identifiers for reports)](/docs/tools/report-converter.md#report-hash-generation-module)\n\n## Helper Scripts\n* [Helper Scripts for daily analysis](script_daily.md)\n\n# Install guide\n\n## Install CodeChecker via `pip`\nCodeChecker is available on the [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/codechecker/)\nand can be installed with the following command:\n```sh\npip3 install codechecker\n```\n\n**Note:** this package can be installed on `Linux`, `OSX` and `Windows`\nsystems where `pip3` command is available. On `OSX`, `intercept-build` must be\ninstalled for logging (`CodeChecker log`). On `Windows`, logging is not\navailable.\n\n## Installing CodeChecker via the `snap` package manager\nCodeChecker is available on the [Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/codechecker)\nand can be installed with the following command:\n```sh\nsudo snap install codechecker --classic\n```\n\n**Note:** Unfortunately, the snap package supports only lower-case command names.\nFor this reason, you need to use `codechecker` command instead of `CodeChecker`\neverywhere. For a full list of available commands in the _codechecker_ snap\npackage, run `snap info codechecker`.\n\n## Linux\n\nFor a detailed dependency list, and for instructions on how to install newer\nClang and Clang-Tidy versions, please see [Requirements](deps.md).\nThe following commands are used to bootstrap CodeChecker on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS:\n\n```sh\n# Install mandatory dependencies for a development and analysis environment.\n# NOTE: clang or clang-tidy can be any sufficiently fresh version, and need not\n#       come from package manager!\n#       In case of Cppcheck, the minimal supported version is 1.80.\n#       In case of gcc, the minimal supported version is 13.0.0.\n#       Infer: https://fbinfer.com/docs/getting-started\nsudo apt-get install clang clang-tidy cppcheck g++ build-essential curl\n      gcc-multilib git python3-dev python3-venv python3-setuptools\n\n# In case of venv_dev target and Ubuntu 23 Linux, install an additional library:\nsudo apt-get install libpq-dev\n\n# Install nodejs dependency for web. In case of Debian/Ubuntu you can use the\n# following commands. For more information see the official docs:\n# https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/\ncurl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash -\nsudo apt-get install -y nodejs\n\n# Check out CodeChecker source code.\ngit clone https://github.com/Ericsson/CodeChecker.git --depth 1 ~/codechecker\ncd ~/codechecker\n\n# Create a Python virtualenv and set it as your environment.\n# NOTE: if you want to develop CodeChecker, use the `venv_dev` target instead\n# of `venv`.\nmake venv\nsource $PWD/venv/bin/activate\n\n# [Optional] If you want to use external authentication methods (LDAP / PAM)\n# follow the instructions in\n# docs/web/authentication.md#external-authentication-methods\n\n# Build and install a CodeChecker package.\nmake package\n\n# For ease of access, add the build directory to PATH.\nexport PATH=\"$PWD/build/CodeChecker/bin:$PATH\"\n\ncd ..\n```\n\n**Notes**:\n- By default, `make package` will build ldlogger shared objects for\n`32bit` and `64bit` too. If you would like to build and package `64 bit only`\nshared objects and ldlogger binary you can set `BUILD_LOGGER_64_BIT_ONLY`\nenvironment variable to `YES` before the package build:\n`BUILD_LOGGER_64_BIT_ONLY=YES make package`.\n- By default, the `make package` will build the UI code if it's not built yet\nor the UI code is changed. If you wouldn't like to build the UI code you can\nset the `BUILD_UI_DIST` environment variable to `NO` before the package build:\n`BUILD_UI_DIST=NO make package`.\n- Use `make standalone_package` instead of `make package` to avoid\nhaving to manually activate the environment before running CodeChecker.\n\n### Upgrading environment after system or Python upgrade\n\nIf you have upgraded your system's Python to a newer version (e.g., from\n`3.8` to `3.11` &ndash; this is the case when upgrading Ubuntu from\n20.04 LTS to 22.04 LTS), the installed environment will not work\nout-of-the-box. To fix this issue, run the following command to upgrade your\n`checker_env` too:\n\n```sh\ncd ~/codechecker/venv\npython3 -m venv .\n```\n\n## Mac OS X\nFor installation instructions for Mac OS X see [Mac OS X Installation Guide](install_macosx.md) documentation.\n\n## Docker\nTo run the CodeChecker server in Docker see the [Docker](web/docker.md) documentation.\nYou can find the CodeChecker web-server container at the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/codechecker/codechecker-web).\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ericsson/codechecker/master/docs/images/docker.jpg\" width=\"100\">\n\n## Visual Studio Code plugin\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ericsson/codechecker/master/docs/images/vscode.png\" width=\"100\">\n\nYou can install and use CodeChecker VSCode extension from the\n[Visual Studio Marketplace](http://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=codechecker.vscode-codechecker)\nor from [Open VSX](http://open-vsx.org/extension/codechecker/codechecker).\n\nMain features:\n- Run CodeChecker analysis from the editor and see the results automatically.\n- Re-analyze the current file when saved.\n- Commands and build tasks for running CodeChecker as part of a build system.\n- Browse through the found reports and show the reproduction steps directly in the code.\n- Navigate between the reproduction steps.\n\n![VSCode plugin](images/vscode.gif)\n\nFor more information how to install and use this plugin see the\n[repository](https://github.com/Ericsson/codecheckervsCodePlugin/) of this\nextension.\n\n## GitHub Actions CI\n\n![CodeChecker executed in GitHub Actions](images/github-actions.png)\n\nCodeChecker can be executed via a reusable GitHub action for your project!\nYou need only specify the build command, as if you would run the analysis\nlocally.\n\nFor more information, check out the\n[CodeChecker Static Analysis](http://github.com/marketplace/actions/codechecker-static-analysis)\naction on the GitHub Actions Marketplace.\n\n# Analyze your first project\n\n## Setting up the environment in your Terminal\n\nThese steps must always be taken in a new command prompt you wish to execute\nanalysis in.\n\n```sh\nsource ~/codechecker/venv/bin/activate\n\n# Path of CodeChecker package\n# NOTE: SKIP this line if you want to always specify CodeChecker's full path.\nexport PATH=~/codechecker/build/CodeChecker/bin:$PATH\n\n# Path of the built LLVM/Clang\n# NOTE: SKIP this line if clang is available in your PATH as an installed Linux package.\nexport PATH=~/<user path>/build/bin:$PATH\n```\n## Execute analysis\n\nAnalyze your project with the `check` command:\n\n    CodeChecker check -b \"cd ~/your-project && make clean && make\" -o ./results\n\n`check` will print an overview of the issues found in your project by the\nanalyzers. The reports will be stored in the `./results` directory in `plist` \nXML format.\n\n## Export the reports as static HTML files\nYou can visualize the results as static HTML by executing\n\n`CodeChecker parse -e html ./results -o ./reports_html`\n\nAn index page will be generated with a list of all repors in \n`./reports_html/index.html` \n\n\n## Optionally store the results in Web server & view the results\n\nIf you have hundreds of results, you may want to store them on the web\nserver with a database backend.\n\nStart a CodeChecker web and storage server in another terminal or as a\nbackground process. By default, it will listen on `localhost:8001`.\n\nThe SQLite database containing the reports will be placed in your workspace\ndirectory (`~/.codechecker` by default), which can be provided via the `-w`\nflag.\n\n    CodeChecker server\n\nStore your analysis reports onto the server to be able to use the Web Viewer.\n\n    CodeChecker store ./results -n my-project\n\nOpen the [CodeChecker Web Viewer](http://localhost:8001) in your browser, and\nyou should be greeted with a web application showing you the analysis results.\n\n\n## Developer documentations\n* [Architecture](architecture.md)\n* [Package layout](package_layout.md)\n* [Dependencies](deps.md)\n* [Thrift interface](web/api/README.md)\n* [Package and integration tests](tests.md)\n\n## Conference papers, presentations\n* An overview about the CodeChecker infrastructure was given at [PLDI 2020](http://pldi20.sigplan.org).<br />\n  **Márton, Gábor and Krupp, Dániel**:<br />\n  [_Tool Talk: CodeChecker_](http://youtube.com/watch?v=bVqrhaoxHlc)\n* A high-level overview about the infrastructure is available amongst the\n  [2015 Euro LLVM Conference](http://llvm.org/devmtg/2015-04) presentations.<br/>\n  **Krupp, Dániel and Orbán, György and Horváth, Gábor and Babati, Bence**:<br/>\n  [_Industrial Experiences with the Clang Static Analysis Toolset_](http://llvm.org/devmtg/2015-04/slides/Clang_static_analysis_toolset_final.pdf)\n",

It can be used in any\napplication that needs safe password storage.\n\nThese recommended keyring backends are supported:\n\n* macOS `Keychain\n  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keychain_%28software%29>`_\n* Freedesktop `Secret Service\n  <http://standards.freedesktop.org/secret-service/>`_ supports many DE including\n  GNOME (requires `secretstorage <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/secretstorage>`_)\n* KDE4 & KDE5 `KWallet <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KWallet>`_\n  (requires `dbus <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dbus-python>`_)\n* `Windows Credential Locker\n  <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/security/credential-locker>`_\n\nOther keyring implementations are available through `Third-Party Backends`_.\n\nInstallation - Linux\n====================\n\nOn Linux, the KWallet backend relies on dbus-python_, which does not always\ninstall correctly when using pip (compilation is needed). For best results,\ninstall dbus-python as a system package.\n\n.. _dbus-python: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/dbus/dbus-python\n\nCompatibility - macOS\n=====================\n\nmacOS keychain supports macOS 11 (Big Sur) and later requires Python 3.8.7\nor later with the \"universal2\" binary. See\n`#525 <https://github.com/jaraco/keyring/issues/525>`_ for details.\n\nUsing Keyring\n=============\n\nThe basic usage of keyring is pretty simple: just call\n``keyring.set_password`` and ``keyring.get_password``::\n\n    >>> import keyring\n    >>> keyring.set_password(\"system\", \"username\", \"password\")\n    >>> keyring.get_password(\"system\", \"username\")\n    'password'\n\nCommand-line Utility\n--------------------\n\nKeyring supplies a ``keyring`` command which is installed with the\npackage. After installing keyring in most environments, the\ncommand should be available for setting, getting, and deleting\npasswords. For more usage information, invoke with no arguments\nor with ``--help`` as so::\n\n    $ keyring --help\n    $ keyring set system username\n    Password for 'username' in 'system':\n    $ keyring get system username\n    password\n\nThe command-line functionality is also exposed as an executable\npackage, suitable for invoking from Python like so::\n\n    $ python -m keyring --help\n    $ python -m keyring set system username\n    Password for 'username' in 'system':\n    $ python -m keyring get system username\n    password\n\nTab Completion\n--------------\n\nIf installed via a package manager (apt, pacman, nix, homebrew, etc),\nthese shell completions may already have been distributed with the package\n(no action required).\n\nKeyring provides tab completion if the ``completion`` extra is installed::\n\n    $ pip install 'keyring[completion]'\n\nThen, generate shell completions, something like::\n\n    $ keyring --print-completion bash | sudo tee /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/keyring\n    $ keyring --print-completion zsh | sudo tee /usr/share/zsh/site-functions/_keyring\n    $ keyring --print-completion tcsh | sudo tee /etc/profile.d/keyring.csh\n\n**Note**: the path of `/usr/share` is mainly for GNU/Linux. For other OSs,\nconsider:\n\n- macOS (Homebrew x86): /usr/local/share\n- macOS (Homebrew ARM): /opt/homebrew/share\n- Android (Termux): /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/share\n- Windows (mingw64 of msys2): /mingw64/share\n- ...\n\nAfter installing the shell completions, enable them following your shell's\nrecommended instructions. e.g.:\n\n- bash: install `bash-completion <https://github.com/scop/bash-completion>`_,\n  and ensure ``. /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion`` in ``~/.bashrc``.\n- zsh: ensure ``autoload -Uz compinit && compinit`` appears in ``~/.zshrc``,\n  then ``grep -w keyring ~/.zcompdump`` to verify keyring appears, indicating\n  it was installed correctly.\n\nConfiguring\n===========\n\nThe python keyring lib contains implementations for several backends. The\nlibrary will attempt to\nautomatically choose the most suitable backend for the current\nenvironment. Users may also specify the preferred keyring in a\nconfig file or by calling the ``set_keyring()`` function.\n\nConfig file path\n----------------\n\nThe configuration is stored in a file named \"keyringrc.cfg\"\nfound in a platform-specific location. To determine\nwhere the config file is stored, run ``keyring diagnose``.\n\nConfig file content\n-------------------\n\nTo specify a keyring backend, set the **default-keyring** option to the\nfull path of the class for that backend, such as\n``keyring.backends.macOS.Keyring``.\n\nIf **keyring-path** is indicated, keyring will add that path to the Python\nmodule search path before loading the backend.\n\nFor example, this config might be used to load the\n``SimpleKeyring`` from the ``simplekeyring`` module in\nthe ``./demo`` directory (not implemented)::\n\n    [backend]\n    default-keyring=simplekeyring.SimpleKeyring\n    keyring-path=demo\n\nThird-Party Backends\n====================\n\nIn addition to the backends provided by the core keyring package for\nthe most common and secure use cases, there\nare additional keyring backend implementations available for other\nuse cases. Simply install them to make them available:\n\n- `keyrings.cryptfile <https://pypi.org/project/keyrings.cryptfile>`_\n  - Encrypted text file storage.\n- `keyrings.alt <https://pypi.org/project/keyrings.alt>`_ - \"alternate\",\n  possibly-insecure backends, originally part of the core package, but\n  available for opt-in.\n- `gsheet-keyring <https://pypi.org/project/gsheet-keyring>`_\n  - a backend that stores secrets in a Google Sheet. For use with\n  `ipython-secrets <https://pypi.org/project/ipython-secrets>`_.\n- `bitwarden-keyring <https://pypi.org/project/bitwarden-keyring/>`_\n  - a backend that stores secrets in the `BitWarden <https://bitwarden.com/>`_\n  password manager.\n- `onepassword-keyring <https://pypi.org/project/onepassword-keyring/>`_\n  - a backend that stores secrets in the `1Password <https://1password.com/>`_ password manager.\n- `sagecipher <https://pypi.org/project/sagecipher>`_ - an encryption\n  backend which uses the ssh agent protocol's signature operation to\n  derive the cipher key.\n- `keyrings.osx_keychain_keys <https://pypi.org/project/keyrings.osx-keychain-keys>`_\n  - OSX keychain key-management, for private, public, and symmetric keys.\n- `keyring_pass.PasswordStoreBackend <https://github.com/nazarewk/keyring_pass>`_\n   - Password Store (pass) backend for python's keyring \n- `keyring_jeepney <https://pypi.org/project/keyring_jeepney>`__ - a\n  pure Python backend using the secret service DBus API for desktop\n  Linux (requires ``keyring<24``).\n\n\nWrite your own keyring backend\n==============================\n\nThe interface for the backend is defined by ``keyring.backend.KeyringBackend``.\nEvery backend should derive from that base class and define a ``priority``\nattribute and three functions: ``get_password()``, ``set_password()``, and\n``delete_password()``. The ``get_credential()`` function may be defined if\ndesired.\n\nSee the ``backend`` module for more detail on the interface of this class.\n\nKeyring employs entry points to allow any third-party package to implement\nbackends without any modification to the keyring itself. Those interested in\ncreating new backends are encouraged to create new, third-party packages\nin the ``keyrings`` namespace, in a manner modeled by the `keyrings.alt\npackage <https://github.com/jaraco/keyrings.alt>`_. See the\n``setup.cfg`` file\nin that project for hints on how to create the requisite entry points.\nBackends that prove essential may be considered for inclusion in the core\nlibrary, although the ease of installing these third-party packages should\nmean that extensions may be readily available.\n\nTo create an extension for Keyring, please submit a pull request to\nhave your extension mentioned as an available extension.\n\nRuntime Configuration\n=====================\n\nKeyring additionally allows programmatic configuration of the\nbackend calling the api ``set_keyring()``. The indicated backend\nwill subsequently be used to store and retrieve passwords.\n\nTo invoke ``set_keyring``::\n\n    # define a new keyring class which extends the KeyringBackend\n    import keyring.backend\n\n    class TestKeyring(keyring.backend.KeyringBackend):\n        \"\"\"A test keyring which always outputs the same password\n        \"\"\"\n        priority = 1\n\n        def set_password(self, servicename, username, password):\n            pass\n\n        def get_password(self, servicename, username):\n            return \"password from TestKeyring\"\n\n        def delete_password(self, servicename, username):\n            pass\n\n    # set the keyring for keyring lib\n    keyring.set_keyring(TestKeyring())\n\n    # invoke the keyring lib\n    try:\n        keyring.set_password(\"demo-service\", \"tarek\", \"passexample\")\n        print(\"password stored successfully\")\n    except keyring.errors.PasswordSetError:\n        print(\"failed to store password\")\n    print(\"password\", keyring.get_password(\"demo-service\", \"tarek\"))\n\n\nDisabling Keyring\n=================\n\nIn many cases, uninstalling keyring will never be necessary.\nEspecially on Windows and macOS, the behavior of keyring is\nusually degenerate, meaning it will return empty values to\nthe caller, allowing the caller to fall back to some other\nbehavior.\n\nIn some cases, the default behavior of keyring is undesirable and\nit would be preferable to disable the keyring behavior altogether.\nThere are several mechanisms to disable keyring:\n\n- Uninstall keyring. Most applications are tolerant to keyring\n  not being installed. Uninstalling keyring should cause those\n  applications to fall back to the behavior without keyring.\n  This approach affects the Python environment where keyring\n  would otherwise have been installed.\n\n- Configure the Null keyring in the environment. Set\n  ``PYTHON_KEYRING_BACKEND=keyring.backends.null.Keyring``\n  in the environment, and the ``Null`` (degenerate) backend\n  will be used. This approach affects all uses of Keyring where\n  that variable is set.\n\n- Permanently configure the Null keyring for the user by running\n  ``keyring --disable`` or ``python -m keyring --disable``.\n  This approach affects all uses of keyring for that user.\n\n\nAltering Keyring Behavior\n=========================\n\nKeyring provides a mechanism to alter the keyring's behavior through\nenvironment variables. Each backend implements a\n``KeyringBackend.set_properties_from_env``, which\nwhen invoked will find all environment variables beginning with\n``KEYRING_PROPERTY_{NAME}`` and will set a property for each\n``{NAME.lower()}`` on the keyring. This method is invoked during\ninitialization for the default/configured keyring.\n\nThis mechanism may be used to set some useful values on various\nkeyrings, including:\n\n- keychain; macOS, path to an alternate keychain file\n- appid; Linux/SecretService, alternate ID for the application\n\n\nUsing Keyring on Ubuntu 16.04\n=============================\n\nThe following is a complete transcript for installing keyring in a\nvirtual environment on Ubuntu 16.04.  No config file was used::\n\n  $ sudo apt install python3-venv libdbus-glib-1-dev\n  $ cd /tmp\n  $ pyvenv py3\n  $ source py3/bin/activate\n  $ pip install -U pip\n  $ pip install secretstorage dbus-python\n  $ pip install keyring\n  $ python\n  >>> import keyring\n  >>> keyring.get_keyring()\n  <keyring.backends.SecretService.Keyring object at 0x7f9b9c971ba8>\n  >>> keyring.set_password(\"system\", \"username\", \"password\")\n  >>> keyring.get_password(\"system\", \"username\")\n  'password'\n\n\nUsing Keyring on headless Linux systems\n=======================================\n\nIt is possible to use the SecretService backend on Linux systems without\nX11 server available (only D-Bus is required). In this case:\n\n* Install the `GNOME Keyring`_ daemon.\n* Start a D-Bus session, e.g. run ``dbus-run-session -- sh`` and run\n  the following commands inside that shell.\n* Run ``gnome-keyring-daemon`` with ``--unlock`` option. The description of\n  that option says:\n\n      Read a password from stdin, and use it to unlock the login keyring\n      or create it if the login keyring does not exist.\n\n  When that command is started, enter a password into stdin and\n  press Ctrl+D (end of data). After that, the daemon will fork into\n  the background (use ``--foreground`` option to block).\n* Now you can use the SecretService backend of Keyring. Remember to\n  run your application in the same D-Bus session as the daemon.\n\n.. _GNOME Keyring: https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeKeyring\n\nUsing Keyring on headless Linux systems in a Docker container\n=============================================================\n\nIt is possible to use keyring with the SecretService backend in Docker containers as well.\nAll you need to do is install the necessary dependencies and add the `--privileged` flag\nto avoid any `Operation not permitted` errors when attempting to unlock the system's keyring.\n\nThe following is a complete transcript for installing keyring on a Ubuntu 18:04 container::\n\n  docker run -it -d --privileged ubuntu:18.04\n\n  $ apt-get update\n  $ apt install -y gnome-keyring python3-venv python3-dev\n  $ python3 -m venv venv\n  $ source venv/bin/activate # source a virtual environment to avoid polluting your system\n  $ pip3 install --upgrade pip\n  $ pip3 install keyring\n  $ dbus-run-session -- sh # this will drop you into a new D-bus shell\n  $ echo 'somecredstorepass' | gnome-keyring-daemon --unlock # unlock the system's keyring\n\n  $ python\n  >>> import keyring\n  >>> keyring.get_keyring()\n  <keyring.backends.SecretService.Keyring object at 0x7f9b9c971ba8>\n  >>> keyring.set_password(\"system\", \"username\", \"password\")\n  >>> keyring.get_password(\"system\", \"username\")\n  'password'\n\nIntegration\n===========\n\nAPI\n---\n\nThe keyring lib has a few functions:\n\n* ``get_keyring()``: Return the currently-loaded keyring implementation.\n* ``get_password(service, username)``: Returns the password stored in the\n  active keyring. If the password does not exist, it will return None.\n* ``get_credential(service, username)``: Return a credential object stored\n  in the active keyring. This object contains at least ``username`` and\n  ``password`` attributes for the specified service, where the returned\n  ``username`` may be different from the argument.\n* ``set_password(service, username, password)``: Store the password in the\n  keyring.\n* ``delete_password(service, username)``: Delete the password stored in\n  keyring. If the password does not exist, it will raise an exception.\n\nIn all cases, the parameters (``service``, ``username``, ``password``)\nshould be Unicode text.\n\n\nExceptions\n----------\n\nThe keyring lib raises the following exceptions:\n\n* ``keyring.errors.KeyringError``: Base Error class for all exceptions in keyring lib.\n* ``keyring.errors.InitError``: Raised when the keyring cannot be initialized.\n* ``keyring.errors.PasswordSetError``: Raised when the password cannot be set in the keyring.\n* ``keyring.errors.PasswordDeleteError``: Raised when the password cannot be deleted in the keyring.\n\nGet Involved\n============\n\nPython keyring lib is an open community project and eagerly\nwelcomes contributors.\n\n* Repository: https://github.com/jaraco/keyring/\n* Bug Tracker: https://github.com/jaraco/keyring/issues/\n* Mailing list: http://groups.google.com/group/python-keyring\n\nSecurity Considerations\n=======================\n\nEach built-in backend may have security considerations to understand\nbefore using this library. Authors of tools or libraries utilizing\n``keyring`` are encouraged to consider these concerns.\n\nAs with any list of known security concerns, this list is not exhaustive.\nAdditional issues can be added as needed.\n\n- macOS Keychain\n    - Any Python script or application can access secrets created by\n      ``keyring`` from that same Python executable without the operating\n      system prompting the user for a password. To cause any specific\n      secret to prompt for a password every time it is accessed, locate\n      the credential using the ``Keychain Access`` application, and in\n      the ``Access Control`` settings, remove ``Python`` from the list\n      of allowed applications.\n\n- Freedesktop Secret Service\n    - No analysis has been performed\n\n- KDE4 & KDE5 KWallet\n    - No analysis has been performed\n\n- Windows Credential Locker\n    - No analysis has been performed\n\nMaking Releases\n===============\n\nThis project makes use of automated releases and continuous\nintegration. The\nsimple workflow is to tag a commit and push it to Github. If it\npasses tests in CI, it will be automatically deployed to PyPI.\n\nOther things to consider when making a release:\n\n- Check that the changelog is current for the intended release.\n\nRunning Tests\n=============\n\nTests are continuously run in Github Actions.\n\nTo run the tests locally, install and invoke\n`tox <https://pypi.org/project/tox>`_.\n\nBackground\n==========\n\nThe project was based on Tarek Ziade's idea in `this post`_. Kang Zhang\ninitially carried it out as a `Google Summer of Code`_ project, and Tarek\nmentored Kang on this project.\n\n.. _this post: http://tarekziade.wordpress.com/2009/03/27/pycon-hallway-session-1-a-keyring-library-for-python/\n.. _Google Summer of Code: http://socghop.appspot.com/\n\nFor Enterprise\n==============\n\nAvailable as part of the Tidelift Subscription.\n\nThis project and the maintainers of thousands of other packages are working with Tidelift to deliver one enterprise subscription that covers all of the open source you use.\n\n`Learn more <https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/pypi-keyring?utm_source=pypi-keyring&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=github>`_.\n",

If you use\nREST framework commercially we strongly encourage you to invest in its\ncontinued development by [signing up for a paid plan][funding].\n\nThe initial aim is to provide a single full-time position on REST framework.\n*Every single sign-up makes a significant impact towards making that possible.*\n\n[![][sentry-img]][sentry-url]\n[![][stream-img]][stream-url]\n[![][spacinov-img]][spacinov-url]\n[![][retool-img]][retool-url]\n[![][bitio-img]][bitio-url]\n[![][posthog-img]][posthog-url]\n[![][cryptapi-img]][cryptapi-url]\n[![][fezto-img]][fezto-url]\n[![][svix-img]][svix-url]\n[![][zuplo-img]][zuplo-url]\n\nMany thanks to all our [wonderful sponsors][sponsors], and in particular to our premium backers, [Sentry][sentry-url], [Stream][stream-url], [Spacinov][spacinov-url], [Retool][retool-url], [bit.io][bitio-url], [PostHog][posthog-url], [CryptAPI][cryptapi-url], [FEZTO][fezto-url], [Svix][svix-url], and [Zuplo][zuplo-url].\n\n---\n\n# Overview\n\nDjango REST framework is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.\n\nSome reasons you might want to use REST framework:\n\n* The Web browsable API is a huge usability win for your developers.\n* [Authentication policies][authentication] including optional packages for [OAuth1a][oauth1-section] and [OAuth2][oauth2-section].\n* [Serialization][serializers] that supports both [ORM][modelserializer-section] and [non-ORM][serializer-section] data sources.\n* Customizable all the way down - just use [regular function-based views][functionview-section] if you don't need the [more][generic-views] [powerful][viewsets] [features][routers].\n* [Extensive documentation][docs], and [great community support][group].\n\n**Below**: *Screenshot from the browsable API*\n\n![Screenshot][image]\n\n----\n\n# Requirements\n\n* Python 3.8+\n* Django 4.2, 5.0, 5.1\n\nWe **highly recommend** and only officially support the latest patch release of\neach Python and Django series.\n\n# Installation\n\nInstall using `pip`...\n\n    pip install djangorestframework\n\nAdd `'rest_framework'` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` setting.\n```python\nINSTALLED_APPS = [\n    ...\n    'rest_framework',\n]\n```\n\n# Example\n\nLet's take a look at a quick example of using REST framework to build a simple model-backed API for accessing users and groups.\n\nStartup up a new project like so...\n\n    pip install django\n    pip install djangorestframework\n    django-admin startproject example .\n    ./manage.py migrate\n    ./manage.py createsuperuser\n\n\nNow edit the `example/urls.py` module in your project:\n\n```python\nfrom django.contrib.auth.models import User\nfrom django.urls import include, path\nfrom rest_framework import routers, serializers, viewsets\n\n\n# Serializers define the API representation.\nclass UserSerializer(serializers.HyperlinkedModelSerializer):\n    class Meta:\n        model = User\n        fields = ['url', 'username', 'email', 'is_staff']\n\n\n# ViewSets define the view behavior.\nclass UserViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):\n    queryset = User.objects.all()\n    serializer_class = UserSerializer\n\n\n# Routers provide a way of automatically determining the URL conf.\nrouter = routers.DefaultRouter()\nrouter.register(r'users', UserViewSet)\n\n# Wire up our API using automatic URL routing.\n# Additionally, we include login URLs for the browsable API.\nurlpatterns = [\n    path('', include(router.urls)),\n    path('api-auth/', include('rest_framework.urls', namespace='rest_framework')),\n]\n```\n\nWe'd also like to configure a couple of settings for our API.\n\nAdd the following to your `settings.py` module:\n\n```python\nINSTALLED_APPS = [\n    ...  # Make sure to include the default installed apps here.\n    'rest_framework',\n]\n\nREST_FRAMEWORK = {\n    # Use Django's standard `django.contrib.auth` permissions,\n    # or allow read-only access for unauthenticated users.\n    'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': [\n        'rest_framework.permissions.DjangoModelPermissionsOrAnonReadOnly',\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThat's it, we're done!\n\n    ./manage.py runserver\n\nYou can now open the API in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`, and view your new 'users' API. If you use the `Login` control in the top right corner you'll also be able to add, create and delete users from the system.\n\nYou can also interact with the API using command line tools such as [`curl`](https://curl.haxx.se/). For example, to list the users endpoint:\n\n    $ curl -H 'Accept: application/json; indent=4' -u admin:password http://127.0.0.1:8000/users/\n    [\n        {\n            \"url\": \"http://127.0.0.1:8000/users/1/\",\n            \"username\": \"admin\",\n            \"email\": \"admin@example.com\",\n            \"is_staff\": true,\n        }\n    ]\n\nOr to create a new user:\n\n    $ curl -X POST -d username=new -d email=new@example.com -d is_staff=false -H 'Accept: application/json; indent=4' -u admin:password http://127.0.0.1:8000/users/\n    {\n        \"url\": \"http://127.0.0.1:8000/users/2/\",\n        \"username\": \"new\",\n        \"email\": \"new@example.com\",\n        \"is_staff\": false,\n    }\n\n# Documentation & Support\n\nFull documentation for the project is available at [https://www.django-rest-framework.org/][docs].\n\nFor questions and support, use the [REST framework discussion group][group], or `#restframework` on libera.chat IRC.\n\n# Security\n\nPlease see the [security policy][security-policy].\n\n[build-status-image]: https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg\n[build-status]: https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework/actions/workflows/main.yml\n[coverage-status-image]: https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/encode/django-rest-framework/master.svg\n[codecov]: https://codecov.io/github/encode/django-rest-framework?branch=master\n[pypi-version]: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/djangorestframework.svg\n[pypi]: https://pypi.org/project/djangorestframework/\n[group]: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/django-rest-framework\n\n[funding]: https://fund.django-rest-framework.org/topics/funding/\n[sponsors]: https://fund.django-rest-framework.org/topics/funding/#our-sponsors\n\n[sentry-img]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/encode/django-rest-framework/master/docs/img/premium/sentry-readme.png\n[stream-img]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/encode/django-rest-framework/master/docs/img/premium/stream-readme.png\n[spacinov-img]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/encode/django-rest-framework/master/docs/img/premium/spacinov-readme.png\n[retool-img]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/encode/django-rest-framework/master/docs/img/premium/retool-readme.png\n[bitio-img]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/encode/django-rest-framework/master/docs/img/premium/bitio-readme.png\n[posthog-img]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/encode/django-rest-framework/master/docs/img/premium/posthog-readme.png\n[cryptapi-img]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/encode/django-rest-framework/master/docs/img/premium/cryptapi-readme.png\n[fezto-img]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/encode/django-rest-framework/master/docs/img/premium/fezto-readme.png\n[svix-img]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/encode/django-rest-framework/master/docs/img/premium/svix-premium.png\n[zuplo-img]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/encode/django-rest-framework/master/docs/img/premium/zuplo-readme.png\n\n[sentry-url]: https://getsentry.com/welcome/\n[stream-url]: https://getstream.io/?utm_source=DjangoRESTFramework&utm_medium=Webpage_Logo_Ad&utm_content=Developer&utm_campaign=DjangoRESTFramework_Jan2022_HomePage\n[spacinov-url]: https://www.spacinov.com/\n[retool-url]: https://retool.com/?utm_source=djangorest&utm_medium=sponsorship\n[bitio-url]: https://bit.io/jobs?utm_source=DRF&utm_medium=sponsor&utm_campaign=DRF_sponsorship\n[posthog-url]: https://posthog.com?utm_source=drf&utm_medium=sponsorship&utm_campaign=open-source-sponsorship\n[cryptapi-url]: https://cryptapi.io\n[fezto-url]: https://www.fezto.xyz/?utm_source=DjangoRESTFramework\n[svix-url]: https://www.svix.com/?utm_source=django-REST&utm_medium=sponsorship\n[zuplo-url]: https://zuplo.link/django-gh\n\n[oauth1-section]: https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/authentication/#django-rest-framework-oauth\n[oauth2-section]: https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/authentication/#django-oauth-toolkit\n[serializer-section]: https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/serializers/#serializers\n[modelserializer-section]: https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/serializers/#modelserializer\n[functionview-section]: https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/views/#function-based-views\n[generic-views]: https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/generic-views/\n[viewsets]: https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/viewsets/\n[routers]: https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/routers/\n[serializers]: https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/serializers/\n[authentication]: https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/authentication/\n[image]: https://www.django-rest-framework.org/img/quickstart.png\n\n[docs]: https://www.django-rest-framework.org/\n[security-policy]: https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework/security/policy\n",

Your support helps promote the project and lets others know that it's worth checking out. \n\nThank you for your support! 🌟\n\n[![Star this project](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/zenml-io/zenml?style=social)](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/stargazers)\n\n## 🤸 Quickstart\n[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/zenml-io/zenml/blob/main/examples/quickstart/quickstart.ipynb)\n\n[Install ZenML](https://docs.zenml.io/getting-started/installation) via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/zenml/). Python 3.9 - 3.12 is required:\n\n```bash\npip install \"zenml[server]\" notebook\n```\n\nTake a tour with the guided quickstart by running:\n\n```bash\nzenml go\n```\n\n## 🪄 Simple, integrated, End-to-end MLOps \n\n### Create machine learning pipelines with minimal code changes\n\nZenML is a MLOps framework intended for data scientists or ML engineers looking to standardize machine learning practices. Just add `@step` and `@pipeline` to your existing Python functions to get going. Here is a toy example:\n\n```python\nfrom zenml import pipeline, step\n\n@step  # Just add this decorator\ndef load_data() -> dict:\n    training_data = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]\n    labels = [0, 1, 0]\n    return {'features': training_data, 'labels': labels}\n\n@step\ndef train_model(data: dict) -> None:\n    total_features = sum(map(sum, data['features']))\n    total_labels = sum(data['labels'])\n    \n    print(f\"Trained model using {len(data['features'])} data points. \"\n          f\"Feature sum is {total_features}, label sum is {total_labels}\")\n\n@pipeline  # This function combines steps together \ndef simple_ml_pipeline():\n    dataset = load_data()\n    train_model(dataset)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    run = simple_ml_pipeline()  # call this to run the pipeline\n   \n```\n\n![Running a ZenML pipeline](/docs/book/.gitbook/assets/readme_basic_pipeline.gif)\n\n### Easily provision an MLOps stack or reuse your existing infrastructure\n\nThe framework is a gentle entry point for practitioners to build complex ML pipelines with little knowledge required of the underlying infrastructure complexity. ZenML pipelines can be run on AWS, GCP, Azure, Airflow, Kubeflow and even on Kubernetes without having to change any code or know underlying internals. \n\nZenML provides different features to aid people to get started quickly on a remote setting as well. If you want to deploy a remote stack from scratch on your selected cloud provider, you can use the 1-click deployment feature either through the dashboard:\n\n![Running a ZenML pipeline](/docs/book/.gitbook/assets/one-click-deployment.gif)\n\nOr, through our CLI command:\n\n```bash\nzenml stack deploy --provider aws\n```\n\nAlternatively, if the necessary pieces of infrastructure is already deployed, you can register a cloud stack seamlessly through the stack wizard:\n\n```bash\nzenml stack register <STACK_NAME> --provider aws\n```\n\nRead more about [ZenML stacks](https://docs.zenml.io/user-guide/production-guide/understand-stacks).\n\n### Run workloads easily on your production infrastructure\n\nOnce you have your MLOps stack configured, you can easily run workloads on it:\n\n```bash\nzenml stack set <STACK_NAME>\npython run.py\n```\n\n```python\nfrom zenml.config import ResourceSettings, DockerSettings\n\n@step(\n  settings={\n    \"resources\": ResourceSettings(memory=\"16GB\", gpu_count=\"1\", cpu_count=\"8\"),\n    \"docker\": DockerSettings(parent_image=\"pytorch/pytorch:1.12.1-cuda11.3-cudnn8-runtime\")\n  }\n)\ndef training(...):\n\t...\n```\n\n![Workloads with ZenML](/docs/book/.gitbook/assets/readme_compute.gif)\n\n### Track models, pipeline, and artifacts\n\nCreate a complete lineage of who, where, and what data and models are produced.\n\nYou’ll be able to find out who produced which model, at what time, with which data, and on which version of the code. This guarantees full reproducibility and auditability.\n\n```python\nfrom zenml import Model\n\n@step(model=Model(name=\"classification\"))\ndef trainer(training_df: pd.DataFrame) -> Annotated[\"model\", torch.nn.Module]:\n\t...\n```\n\n![Exploring ZenML Models](/docs/book/.gitbook/assets/readme_mcp.gif)\n\n### Purpose built for machine learning with integration to you favorite tools\n\nWhile ZenML brings a lot of value of the box, it also integrates into your existing tooling and infrastructure without you having to be locked in.\n\n```python\nfrom bentoml._internal.bento import bento\n\n@step(on_failure=alert_slack, experiment_tracker=\"mlflow\")\ndef train_and_deploy(training_df: pd.DataFrame) -> bento.Bento\n\tmlflow.autolog()\n\t...\n\treturn bento\n```\n\n![Exploring ZenML Integrations](/docs/book/.gitbook/assets/readme_integrations.gif)\n\n## 🖼️ Learning\n\nThe best way to learn about ZenML is the [docs](https://docs.zenml.io/). We recommend beginning with the [Starter Guide](https://docs.zenml.io/user-guide/starter-guide) to get up and running quickly.\n\nIf you are a visual learner, this 11-minute video tutorial is also a great start:\n\n[![Introductory Youtube Video](docs/book/.gitbook/assets/readme_youtube_thumbnail.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEVwIkDvUPs)\n\nAnd finally, here are some other examples and use cases for inspiration:\n\n1. [E2E Batch Inference](examples/e2e/): Feature engineering, training, and inference pipelines for tabular machine learning.\n2. [Basic NLP with BERT](examples/e2e_nlp/): Feature engineering, training, and inference focused on NLP.\n3.

They also come with additional features like RBAC, a Model Control Plane\nand [much more](https://zenml-io.gitbook.io/zenml-documentation/getting-started/zenml-pro.\n- **Self-hosted deployment**: Alternatively, you have the flexibility to [deploy\nZenML on your own self-hosted environment](https://docs.zenml.io/getting-started/deploying-zenml#deploying-a-zenml-server).\nThis can be achieved through various methods, including using our CLI, Docker,\nHelm, or HuggingFace Spaces.\n\n## Use ZenML with VS Code\n\nZenML has a [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ZenML.zenml-vscode) that allows you to inspect your stacks and pipeline runs directly from your editor. The extension also allows you to switch your stacks without needing to type any CLI commands.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>🖥️ VS Code Extension in Action!</summary>\n  <div align=\"center\">\n  <img width=\"60%\" src=\"/docs/book/.gitbook/assets/zenml-extension-shortened.gif\" alt=\"ZenML Extension\">\n</div>\n</details>\n\n## 🗺 Roadmap\n\nZenML is being built in public. The [roadmap](https://zenml.io/roadmap) is a regularly updated source of truth for the ZenML community to understand where the product is going in the short, medium, and long term.\n\nZenML is managed by a [core team](https://zenml.io/company) of developers that are responsible for making key decisions and incorporating feedback from the community.

Example:\n\t- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`\n\t- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n\t- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n\t- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n\t-\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n\t- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`\n\t- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`\n\t- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n\t- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://coderabbit.ai/docs) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](https://discord.com/invite/GsXnASn26c) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->",

Example:\n\t- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`\n\t- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n\t- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n\t- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n\t-\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n\t- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`\n\t- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`\n\t- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n\t- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review.

The main changes include the implementation of an `is_admin` flag for user accounts, which distinguishes between admin and non-admin users. This flag is crucial for controlling access to specific operations through the REST interface, ensuring that only admins can perform sensitive actions.\n\nAdmin users are granted exclusive permissions to list all users, create new users, access and modify other users' information, deactivate or delete user accounts. In contrast, regular users are limited to managing their own account details and activating a user account. These restrictions are designed to safeguard the system against unauthorized access and modifications, enhancing overall security.\n\nThe PR also specifies that these new access controls are implemented in a manner that does not interfere with existing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) functionalities, particularly within the ZenML Cloud environment. This ensures that the new features can coexist with the current RBAC system without causing any disruptions or conflicts.\n\nTo support these changes, the PR includes updates to documentation, the addition of tests to cover the new functionalities, and modifications to various components of the system, including CLI commands, models, and server utilities. The contributor has followed the project's contribution guidelines, ensuring that the new branch is based on `develop` and that all pre-requisites for a successful PR have been met.\n\n### Comments Summary\n\nThe PR received feedback from a reviewer, avishniakov, who suggested improvements for the unit tests and conducted a thorough local test to assess the impact of the changes on the dashboard. The reviewer identified several areas for improvement, particularly regarding the creation and updating of user accounts through the Client/CLI and the dashboard. These include the inability to set or change a user's admin status upon account creation or update, and the need for the dashboard to reflect a user's admin status accurately.\n\nThe reviewer also highlighted a potential vulnerability where a non-admin user could elevate their status to admin during the first login process. This issue was addressed, and the backend points related to user activation and admin status were fixed. However, the dashboard-related enhancements were deferred to a separate task tracked in the project's issue tracking system.\n\nStefannica, the contributor, acknowledged the feedback and incorporated the suggested improvements into the PR. The changes were re-tested and confirmed to work as expected.\n\n### AI-Generated Summary of Generated Summaries\n\nThe PR introduces an `is_admin` flag to distinguish between admin and non-admin users, applying this distinction across various components of the system, including CLI commands, client functions, models, and server utilities. Admin users are granted exclusive permissions for sensitive operations, such as user management tasks, while regular users are limited to managing their own account details.\n\nSignificant changes include the addition of the `is_admin` flag to user creation and update functions, both in the CLI and the client layer, and the introduction of this flag in various user models. The server's authentication and permission verification mechanisms have been updated to accommodate the new admin concept, ensuring that only admins can perform certain actions unless RBAC settings override these restrictions.\n\nThe database schema has been updated to include an `is_admin` column for user management, and tests have been added to cover the new functionalities and ensure that admin and non-admin users are handled correctly. The PR also addresses a potential security vulnerability related to user activation and admin status elevation.\n\nDashboard-related enhancements, such as reflecting a user's admin status and modifying user creation and update functionalities to include admin status settings, have been identified but are to be addressed in a separate task.\n\n-->\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: short summary by coderabbit.ai --><!-- commit_ids_reviewed_start -->\n\n<!-- 5c4545713838f0b28edfea7c9768339d2d899c2d -->\n\n<!-- commit_ids_reviewed_end --><!-- tweet_start -->\n\nThank you for using CodeRabbit.

Specifically, it applies rate limiting to authentication endpoints, ensuring they can only be accessed a certain number of times per minute or day. This measure helps protect the server from potential overload or attack by regulating access frequency.\n\n## Changes\n\n| File Path                        | Change Summary                                         |\n|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| `pyproject.toml`                 | Added `slowapi` as an optional dependency (`>=0.1.9`). |\n| `.../zen_server/routers/auth_endpoints.py` | Imported `Limiter` and `get_remote_address` from `slowapi`; initialized `limiter` with `Limiter(key_func=get_remote_address)`; added rate limiting (`5/minute;1000/day`) to the `token` function. |\n\n> 🐰✨  \n> In the land of code and might,  \n> A new guard rises, shining bright.  \n> \"Slow and steady,\" it firmly said,  \n> Keeping the server safe, ahead.  \n> With every hop, it sets the pace,  \n> Ensuring all find their rightful place.  \n> 🌟🐾\n\n<!-- walkthrough_end --><!-- This is an auto-generated comment: raw summary by coderabbit.ai -->\n<!--\n\n\npyproject.toml: ## Short summary\n\nAdded `slowapi` as an optional dependency with version `>=0.1.9`.\n\nsrc/zenml/zen_server/routers/auth_endpoints.py: ## Short summary\n\nAdded import statements for `Limiter` and `get_remote_address`.

This change aims to mitigate misuse and excessive login attempts, enhancing the overall security posture of the system. The contributor has completed several preparatory steps to ensure the quality and compatibility of this change, including reading the contributing guidelines, potentially updating documentation, basing their work on the `develop` branch, and communicating necessary changes to the dashboard if required. Although the PR does not include new tests to cover the changes, it marks a significant bug fix by adding rate limiting to an area previously lacking this safeguard. The changes are categorized under bug fixes, indicating an improvement to existing functionality without introducing new features or breaking changes.\n\n### Comments Summary\n\nThe comment from `avishniakov` directly requests a review from `@coderabbitai`. This indicates a need for evaluation and feedback on the implemented changes. There are no further comments providing additional context or raising specific concerns about the PR. Thus, the primary focus from the comments is on obtaining a thorough review of the modifications made to introduce rate limiting to the login API.\n\n### AI-generated Summary of Generated Summaries\n\nThe PR introduces rate limiting to the login API by incorporating `slowapi` as an optional dependency, specified to be version `>=0.1.9` in `pyproject.toml`. In `src/zenml/zen_server/routers/auth_endpoints.py`, the changes involve importing `Limiter` and `get_remote_address` to initialize a `limiter` instance with `Limiter(key_func=get_remote_address)`. The `token` function, responsible for handling login attempts, is now decorated with a rate limit of \"5/minute;1000/day\" to prevent misuse and excessive login attempts. This enhancement is a direct response to the previously identified gap in security measures, specifically addressing the need for rate limiting to protect against potential abuse. The implementation details, including the choice of rate limits and the use of `slowapi`, reflect a targeted approach to improving the system's resilience against brute-force attacks and other forms of abuse that could compromise user security and system integrity.\n\n-->\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: short summary by coderabbit.ai --><!-- commit_ids_reviewed_start -->\n\n<!-- 32c06cb5bbdc003647756b59c6379d3c250cabc0 -->\n\n<!-- commit_ids_reviewed_end --><!-- tweet_start -->\n\nThank you for using CodeRabbit.

Successful requests do not affect limits. This might be an issue indeed for users behind VPN, for instance (they all might land on the same IP).\r\n\r\nDue to all those complications, we can drop this feature completely for OSS.

Successful requests do not affect limits. This might be an issue indeed for users behind VPN, for instance (they all might land on the same IP).\r\n> \r\n> Due to all those complications, we can drop this feature completely for OSS. Based on my research - everything inside HTTP request can be spoofed, so we cannot rely really on any header or other info to make a weighted decision if this is the same requestor or not. I don't know what folks from CDN solution use to prevent DDoS and other things, but we are not CDN provider 🙂\r\n\r\nThere's probably been a misunderstanding, it's not really k8s or other infra that's bombarding REST with incorrect credentials. This is what can happen if the ZenML server or the kubernetes cluster or load balancer, or proxy is incorrectly configured:\r\n* let's say you have 100 legit users regularly logging in\r\n* let's also say you have an attacker trying to brute-force his way into the server\r\n* when incorrectly configured, the server \"sees\" all requests coming from a single IP: the IP of the proxy or load-balancer\r\n* the \"bad\" requests will pile up until the limiter starts blocking traffic from that IP address, effectively stopping everyone from logging in, even the legit users\r\n\r\nWe should still offer the limiter as a feature, because it's a great thing to have for security, but have some way of configuring it and keeping it disabled by default. If the admins enable it, it's their responsibility to correctly configure the surrounding infrastructure (proxy/load-balancer/whatever).",

It modifies the schema to include this constraint and enhances the transaction management in the SQL store. Exception handling is improved with specific attention to `IntegrityError`, streamlining the process of checking for existing entities before their creation.\n\n## Changes\n\n| File Path                         | Change Summary                                                           |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `.../migrations/versions/72675226b2de_unique_users.py` | Adds a migration script for unique constraint on `user` table.          |\n| `.../zen_stores/schemas/user_schemas.py`               | Introduces `UniqueConstraint` in `UserSchema`.                           |\n| `.../zen_stores/sql_zen_store.py`                       | Enhances transaction management and exception handling for entity creation. |\n\n> 🐇✨  \n> To the database, we hop and bound,  \n> With unique users, no duplicates found.  \n> Try and catch, we gracefully manage,  \n> Ensuring integrity, with no damage.  \n> So here's to changes, both big and small,  \n> May our code run smoothly, bugs none at all.  \n> 🌟🐾\n\n<!-- walkthrough_end --><!-- This is an auto-generated comment: raw summary by coderabbit.ai -->\n<!--\n\n\nsrc/zenml/zen_stores/migrations/versions/72675226b2de_unique_users.py: This file introduces a migration script that adds a unique constraint to the \"user\" table on columns \"name\" and \"is_service_account.\"\n\n---\n\nsrc/zenml/zen_stores/schemas/user_schemas.py: Added a `UniqueConstraint` to the `UserSchema` table definition in `user_schemas.py`.\n\n---\n\nsrc/zenml/zen_stores/sql_zen_store.py: \n- The code now uses `try-except` blocks with `IntegrityError` handling for transaction management.\n- The logic for checking existing entities before creation has been updated to handle exceptions more effectively.\n\n-->\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: raw summary by coderabbit.ai --><!-- This is an auto-generated comment: short summary by coderabbit.ai -->\n<!--\n\n\n### PR Objectives\n\nThe pull request (PR) number 2483, titled \"Uniquely constrained users table,\" aims to address an issue related to the duplication of user data in the database. The submitter has implemented a fix to ensure that the UserSchema does not allow duplicate entries at the database level, enhancing data integrity and consistency within the application's user management system.\n\nThe changes made in this PR involve the introduction of a unique constraint on the \"user\" table, specifically targeting the \"name\" and \"is_service_account\" columns to prevent the insertion of duplicate records. This modification is critical for maintaining a clean and reliable user database, especially in systems where the distinction between regular users and service accounts is vital.\n\nBefore submitting the PR, the author has adhered to several pre-requisites, including reading the contributing document, updating documentation if necessary, adding tests to cover the changes, basing their branch on `develop`, and communicating any dashboard-related changes. The types of changes introduced by this PR are categorized under \"Bug fix,\" indicating that the primary goal is to rectify an existing issue without introducing new features or breaking changes.\n\n### Comments Summary\n\nThe comment on the PR from `avishniakov` is a direct request for a review from `@coderabbitai`. This indicates that the PR is ready for evaluation and possibly requires expertise or insights from the mentioned reviewer. There are no additional comments providing further context or feedback on the PR, suggesting that the discussion is in its early stages or that the changes are straightforward enough not to warrant immediate concerns or questions from other contributors.\n\n### AI-Generated Summary of Generated Summaries\n\nThe PR introduces a set of changes aimed at enhancing the uniqueness constraints within the user management system of the application. Specifically, a migration script has been added to enforce a unique constraint on the \"name\" and \"is_service_account\" columns of the \"user\" table, ensuring that duplicate entries are prevented at the database level. This is further supported by modifications in the `UserSchema` within `user_schemas.py`, where a `UniqueConstraint` has been explicitly defined to uphold this requirement.\n\nAdditionally, the PR includes updates to the `sql_zen_store.py` file, where transaction management has been improved through the use of `try-except` blocks specifically designed to catch `IntegrityError`. This enhancement not only aids in handling exceptions more effectively but also updates the logic for checking existing entities before their creation, thereby reinforcing the overall integrity and reliability of the user data management process.\n\nIn summary, PR 2483 focuses on fixing an issue related to user data duplication by implementing unique constraints and improving exception handling mechanisms, thereby ensuring the integrity and uniqueness of user records in the database.\n\n-->\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: short summary by coderabbit.ai --><!-- commit_ids_reviewed_start -->\n\n<!-- 135c2e05e7350f1b49ccddcf450e6533143900a7 -->\n\n<!-- commit_ids_reviewed_end --><!-- tweet_start -->\n\nThank you for using CodeRabbit.

The changes ensure entities are uniquely created without duplication even when multiple requests are made in parallel, alongside improved error handling for entity existence.\n\n## Changes\n\n| File Path                                               | Change Summary                                                                 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `src/zenml/.../sql_zen_store.py`                        | Enhanced entity creation order, existence checks, and error handling.          |\n| `tests/integration/functional/zen_stores/.../test_zen_store.py` | Added tests for parallel user and service account creation without duplication.|\n\n> 🐇✨  \n> In the realm of code where the data flows,  \n> A rabbit hopped, fixing bugs in rows.  \n> No duplicates found, in parallel they thrive,  \n> Ensuring entities uniquely arrive.  \n> With each hop and leap, the code does improve,  \n> In the ZenML land, smooth and on the move.  \n> 🌟🐾\n\n<!-- walkthrough_end --><!-- This is an auto-generated comment: raw summary by coderabbit.ai -->\n<!--\n\n\nsrc/zenml/zen_stores/sql_zen_store.py: ## Short summary\n\nIn the `sql_zen_store.py` file, the changes involve reordering the creation of entities within a session, checking for existing entities before committing, adjusting error handling for entity existence.\n\n---\n\ntests/integration/functional/zen_stores/test_zen_store.py: ## Short summary\n\n- Added import for `threading`.\n- Added import for `UserFilter`.\n- Added a new test `test_creating_users_in_parallel_do_not_duplicate_fails` to test creating users in parallel without duplication.\n- Added a new test `test_creating_service_accounts_in_parallel_do_not_duplicate_fails` to test creating service accounts in parallel without duplication.\n\n-->\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: raw summary by coderabbit.ai --><!-- This is an auto-generated comment: short summary by coderabbit.ai -->\n<!--\n\n\n### PR Objectives\n\nThe pull request (PR) #2479 addresses a critical issue related to the creation of new users and service accounts under heavy race conditions, such as when there are 100 simultaneous requests to create a new user. The submitter has identified and fixed a race condition that allowed for the creation of duplicate usernames, which is a significant bug fix enhancing the system's integrity and reliability.\n\nThe changes made include adjustments to the conditional checks during the user and service account creation process to prevent duplicates from occurring even under heavy load. This fix is crucial for maintaining the uniqueness of usernames across the system, which is fundamental for user identification and management.\n\nThe contributor has followed all the necessary pre-requisites for submitting the PR, including reading the contributing document, updating documentation if required, adding tests to cover the changes, basing the new branch on `develop`, and communicating any dashboard changes. The type of change is categorized under \"Bug fix,\" indicating that it resolves an issue without introducing new features or breaking existing functionality.\n\n### Comments Summary\n\nIn the comments section of the PR, there are two notable interactions:\n\n1. **GitGuardian Alert**: A comment from `avishniakov` highlights an alert from GitGuardian, which detected a hardcoded secret in the pull request. However, this was immediately addressed by the commenter as a false positive. This interaction is crucial as it concerns security and the integrity of the codebase, but since it's identified as a false positive, it doesn't impact the PR's review process directly.\n\n2. **Review Request**: `strickvl` has requested a review from `coderabbitai`. This indicates that the PR is ready for further examination and evaluation by peers or automated systems to ensure the changes meet the project's standards and effectively address the issue at hand.\n\n### AI-Generated Summary of Generated Summaries\n\nThe pull request introduces modifications primarily within the `sql_zen_store.py` file and the integration tests to address a race condition issue that allowed the creation of duplicate usernames during high concurrency scenarios. The core changes involve enhancing the logic for checking the existence of entities before committing their creation to the database and refining error handling related to entity existence checks. Specifically, the adjustments ensure that during the creation process of users and service accounts, the system now correctly identifies and prevents the creation of duplicates, thereby maintaining the uniqueness and integrity of usernames.\n\nAdditionally, the integration tests have been expanded to include new tests that simulate the parallel creation of users and service accounts, ensuring that the fixes are effective and that such race conditions are appropriately handled. These tests leverage threading to mimic concurrent requests, providing a robust validation for the changes made.\n\nIn summary, the PR effectively addresses a significant race condition issue by refining the entity creation process and enhancing the system's ability to handle high concurrency scenarios without compromising the uniqueness of usernames. The inclusion of targeted integration tests further ensures the reliability and effectiveness of these changes.\n\n-->\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: short summary by coderabbit.ai --><!-- commit_ids_reviewed_start -->\n\n<!-- 618770b84cc75d2478070fc47a6a7da2848668ae -->\n\n<!-- commit_ids_reviewed_end --><!-- tweet_start -->\n\nThank you for using CodeRabbit.

For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- The JSON schema for the configuration file is available [here](https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/coderabbit-overrides.v2.json).\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/coderabbit-overrides.v2.json`\n\n### CodeRabbit Discord Community\n\nJoin our [Discord Community](https://discord.com/invite/GsXnASn26c) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->",

The main changes include the implementation of an `is_admin` flag for user accounts, which distinguishes between admin and non-admin users. This flag is crucial for controlling access to specific operations through the REST interface, ensuring that only admins can perform sensitive actions.\n\nAdmin users are granted exclusive permissions to list all users, create new users, access and modify other users' information, deactivate or delete user accounts. In contrast, regular users are limited to managing their own account details and activating a user account. These restrictions are designed to safeguard the system against unauthorized access and modifications, enhancing overall security.\n\nThe PR also specifies that these new access controls are implemented in a manner that does not interfere with existing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) functionalities, particularly within the ZenML Cloud environment. This ensures that the new features can coexist with the current RBAC system without causing any disruptions or conflicts.\n\nTo support these changes, the PR includes updates to documentation, the addition of tests to cover the new functionalities, and modifications to various components of the system, including CLI commands, models, and server utilities. The contributor has followed the project's contribution guidelines, ensuring that the new branch is based on `develop` and that all pre-requisites for a successful PR have been met.\n\n### Comments Summary\n\nThe PR received feedback from a reviewer, avishniakov, who suggested improvements for the unit tests and conducted a thorough local test to assess the impact of the changes on the dashboard. The reviewer identified several areas for improvement, particularly regarding the creation and updating of user accounts through the Client/CLI and the dashboard. These include the inability to set or change a user's admin status upon account creation or update, and the need for the dashboard to reflect a user's admin status accurately.\n\nThe reviewer also highlighted a potential vulnerability where a non-admin user could elevate their status to admin during the first login process. This issue was addressed, and the backend points related to user activation and admin status were fixed. However, the dashboard-related enhancements were deferred to a separate task tracked in the project's issue tracking system.\n\nStefannica, the contributor, acknowledged the feedback and incorporated the suggested improvements into the PR. The changes were re-tested and confirmed to work as expected.\n\n### AI-Generated Summary of Generated Summaries\n\nThe PR introduces an `is_admin` flag to distinguish between admin and non-admin users, applying this distinction across various components of the system, including CLI commands, client functions, models, and server utilities. Admin users are granted exclusive permissions for sensitive operations, such as user management tasks, while regular users are limited to managing their own account details.\n\nSignificant changes include the addition of the `is_admin` flag to user creation and update functions, both in the CLI and the client layer, and the introduction of this flag in various user models. The server's authentication and permission verification mechanisms have been updated to accommodate the new admin concept, ensuring that only admins can perform certain actions unless RBAC settings override these restrictions.\n\nThe database schema has been updated to include an `is_admin` column for user management, and tests have been added to cover the new functionalities and ensure that admin and non-admin users are handled correctly.

Example:\n\t- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`\n\t- `Generate unit-tests for this file.`\n\t- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n\t- `@coderabbitai generate unit tests for this file.`\n\t-\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n\t- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`\n\t- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`\n\t- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit tests.`\n\t- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- The JSON schema for the configuration file is available [here](https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/coderabbit-overrides.v2.json).\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/coderabbit-overrides.v2.json`\n\n### CodeRabbit Discord Community\n\nJoin our [Discord Community](https://discord.com/invite/GsXnASn26c) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->",

This change aims to mitigate misuse and excessive login attempts, enhancing the overall security posture of the system. The contributor has completed several preparatory steps to ensure the quality and compatibility of this change, including reading the contributing guidelines, potentially updating documentation, basing their work on the `develop` branch, and communicating necessary changes to the dashboard if required. Although the PR does not include new tests to cover the changes, it marks a significant bug fix by adding rate limiting to an area previously lacking this safeguard. The changes are categorized under bug fixes, indicating an improvement to existing functionality without introducing new features or breaking changes.\n\n### Comments Summary\n\nThe comment from `avishniakov` directly requests a review from `@coderabbitai`. This indicates a need for evaluation and feedback on the implemented changes. There are no further comments providing additional context or raising specific concerns about the PR. Thus, the primary focus from the comments is on obtaining a thorough review of the modifications made to introduce rate limiting to the login API.\n\n### AI-generated Summary of Generated Summaries\n\nThe PR introduces rate limiting to the login API by incorporating `slowapi` as an optional dependency, specified to be version `>=0.1.9` in `pyproject.toml`. In `src/zenml/zen_server/routers/auth_endpoints.py`, the changes involve importing `Limiter` and `get_remote_address` to initialize a `limiter` instance with `Limiter(key_func=get_remote_address)`. The `token` function, responsible for handling login attempts, is now decorated with a rate limit of \"5/minute;1000/day\" to prevent misuse and excessive login attempts. This enhancement is a direct response to the previously identified gap in security measures, specifically addressing the need for rate limiting to protect against potential abuse. The implementation details, including the choice of rate limits and the use of `slowapi`, reflect a targeted approach to improving the system's resilience against brute-force attacks and other forms of abuse that could compromise user security and system integrity.\n\n-->\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: short summary by coderabbit.ai --><!-- commit_ids_reviewed_start -->\n\n<!-- 32c06cb5bbdc003647756b59c6379d3c250cabc0 -->\n\n<!-- commit_ids_reviewed_end --><!-- tweet_start -->\n\nThank you for using CodeRabbit.

Example:\n\t- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`\n\t- `Generate unit-tests for this file.`\n\t- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n\t- `@coderabbitai generate unit tests for this file.`\n\t-\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n\t- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`\n\t- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`\n\t- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit tests.`\n\t- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks.

This is what can happen if the ZenML server or the kubernetes cluster or load balancer, or proxy is incorrectly configured:\r\n* let's say you have 100 legit users regularly logging in\r\n* let's also say you have an attacker trying to brute-force his way into the server\r\n* when incorrectly configured, the server \"sees\" all requests coming from a single IP: the IP of the proxy or load-balancer\r\n* the \"bad\" requests will pile up until the limiter starts blocking traffic from that IP address, effectively stopping everyone from logging in, even the legit users\r\n\r\nWe should still offer the limiter as a feature, because it's a great thing to have for security, but have some way of configuring it and keeping it disabled by default. If the admins enable it, it's their responsibility to correctly configure the surrounding infrastructure (proxy/load-balancer/whatever).",

The submitter has implemented a fix to ensure that the UserSchema does not allow duplicate entries at the database level, enhancing data integrity and consistency within the application's user management system.\n\nThe changes made in this PR involve the introduction of a unique constraint on the \"user\" table, specifically targeting the \"name\" and \"is_service_account\" columns to prevent the insertion of duplicate records. This modification is critical for maintaining a clean and reliable user database, especially in systems where the distinction between regular users and service accounts is vital.\n\nBefore submitting the PR, the author has adhered to several pre-requisites, including reading the contributing document, updating documentation if necessary, adding tests to cover the changes, basing their branch on `develop`, and communicating any dashboard-related changes. The types of changes introduced by this PR are categorized under \"Bug fix,\" indicating that the primary goal is to rectify an existing issue without introducing new features or breaking changes.\n\n### Comments Summary\n\nThe comment on the PR from `avishniakov` is a direct request for a review from `@coderabbitai`. This indicates that the PR is ready for evaluation and possibly requires expertise or insights from the mentioned reviewer. There are no additional comments providing further context or feedback on the PR, suggesting that the discussion is in its early stages or that the changes are straightforward enough not to warrant immediate concerns or questions from other contributors.\n\n### AI-Generated Summary of Generated Summaries\n\nThe PR introduces a set of changes aimed at enhancing the uniqueness constraints within the user management system of the application. Specifically, a migration script has been added to enforce a unique constraint on the \"name\" and \"is_service_account\" columns of the \"user\" table, ensuring that duplicate entries are prevented at the database level. This is further supported by modifications in the `UserSchema` within `user_schemas.py`, where a `UniqueConstraint` has been explicitly defined to uphold this requirement.\n\nAdditionally, the PR includes updates to the `sql_zen_store.py` file, where transaction management has been improved through the use of `try-except` blocks specifically designed to catch `IntegrityError`. This enhancement not only aids in handling exceptions more effectively but also updates the logic for checking existing entities before their creation, thereby reinforcing the overall integrity and reliability of the user data management process.\n\nIn summary, PR 2483 focuses on fixing an issue related to user data duplication by implementing unique constraints and improving exception handling mechanisms, thereby ensuring the integrity and uniqueness of user records in the database.\n\n-->\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: short summary by coderabbit.ai --><!-- commit_ids_reviewed_start -->\n\n<!-- 135c2e05e7350f1b49ccddcf450e6533143900a7 -->\n\n<!-- commit_ids_reviewed_end --><!-- tweet_start -->\n\nThank you for using CodeRabbit.

The submitter has identified and fixed a race condition that allowed for the creation of duplicate usernames, which is a significant bug fix enhancing the system's integrity and reliability.\n\nThe changes made include adjustments to the conditional checks during the user and service account creation process to prevent duplicates from occurring even under heavy load. This fix is crucial for maintaining the uniqueness of usernames across the system, which is fundamental for user identification and management.\n\nThe contributor has followed all the necessary pre-requisites for submitting the PR, including reading the contributing document, updating documentation if required, adding tests to cover the changes, basing the new branch on `develop`, and communicating any dashboard changes. The type of change is categorized under \"Bug fix,\" indicating that it resolves an issue without introducing new features or breaking existing functionality.\n\n### Comments Summary\n\nIn the comments section of the PR, there are two notable interactions:\n\n1. **GitGuardian Alert**: A comment from `avishniakov` highlights an alert from GitGuardian, which detected a hardcoded secret in the pull request. However, this was immediately addressed by the commenter as a false positive. This interaction is crucial as it concerns security and the integrity of the codebase, but since it's identified as a false positive, it doesn't impact the PR's review process directly.\n\n2. **Review Request**: `strickvl` has requested a review from `coderabbitai`. This indicates that the PR is ready for further examination and evaluation by peers or automated systems to ensure the changes meet the project's standards and effectively address the issue at hand.\n\n### AI-Generated Summary of Generated Summaries\n\nThe pull request introduces modifications primarily within the `sql_zen_store.py` file and the integration tests to address a race condition issue that allowed the creation of duplicate usernames during high concurrency scenarios. The core changes involve enhancing the logic for checking the existence of entities before committing their creation to the database and refining error handling related to entity existence checks. Specifically, the adjustments ensure that during the creation process of users and service accounts, the system now correctly identifies and prevents the creation of duplicates, thereby maintaining the uniqueness and integrity of usernames.\n\nAdditionally, the integration tests have been expanded to include new tests that simulate the parallel creation of users and service accounts, ensuring that the fixes are effective and that such race conditions are appropriately handled. These tests leverage threading to mimic concurrent requests, providing a robust validation for the changes made.\n\nIn summary, the PR effectively addresses a significant race condition issue by refining the entity creation process and enhancing the system's ability to handle high concurrency scenarios without compromising the uniqueness of usernames.

Example:\n\t- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`\n\t- `Generate unit-tests for this file.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n\t- `@coderabbitai generate unit tests for this file.`\n\t-\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n\t- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository from git and render them as a table.`\n\t- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`\n\t- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit tests.`\n\t- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- The JSON schema for the configuration file is available [here](https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/coderabbit-overrides.v2.json).\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/coderabbit-overrides.v2.json`\n\n### CodeRabbit Discord Community\n\nJoin our [Discord Community](https://discord.com/invite/GsXnASn26c) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->",

Unexpected crashes may occur.\n\n### Extra Dependencies\n\nExtra dependencies are non-essential packages that enable additional features of pyLoad.\n\nTo install them you have to append a specific tag name to the installation command.\n\n#### Available tags\n\n-   `plugins`: includes packages used by several plugins.\n-   `build`: includes packages used to [build translations](#build-translations).\n-   `all`: includes both plugins and build packages.\n\nYou can use a tag in this way:\n\n    pip install pyload-ng[plugins]\n\nOr group more together:\n\n    pip install pyload-ng[plugins][build]\n\n### Build Translations\n\nUse the command `build_locale` to retrieve and build the latest locale files (translations):\n\n    python setup.py build_locale\n\nInvoke `build_locale` before building the package (eg. `bdist_wheel`).\n\n> **Note**:\n>\n> You don't need to build the translations if you installed pyLoad through `pip`, they're already included.\n\n## Report a Vulnerability\n\nPlease refer to [SECURITY](https://github.com/pyload/pyload/blob/main/SECURITY.md) to read our security policy.\n\n## Contribute to pyLoad\n\nPlease refer to [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/pyload/pyload/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to read our contribution guidelines.\n\n## Docker Images\n\n[![Docker build status](https://img.shields.io/docker/build/pyload/pyload?style=flat-square)](https://hub.docker.com/r/pyload/pyload)\n[![MicroBadger layers](https://img.shields.io/microbadger/layers/pyload/pyload?style=flat-square)](https://microbadger.com/images/pyload/pyload)\n[![MicroBadger size](https://img.shields.io/microbadger/image-size/pyload/pyload?style=flat-square)](https://microbadger.com/images/pyload/pyload)\n\n#### Available images\n\n-   `pyload/pyload:alpine`: docker image for amd64, arm and arm64v8.\n-   `pyload/pyload:ubuntu-arm32v7`: docker image for arm32v7.\n-   `pyload/pyload`: alias of `pyload/pyload:alpine`.\n\n### Create Container\n\n    docker create --name=pyload -v <USERDIR>:/config -v <STORAGEDIR>:/downloads --restart unless-stopped pyload/pyload\n\n> **Note**:\n>\n> Replace `<STORAGEDIR>` with the location on the host machine where you want that downloads will be saved.\n>\n> Replace `<USERDIR>` with where you want that user data files (configurations) are stored.\n\n### Start Container\n\n    docker start pyload\n\n### Stop Container\n\n    docker stop pyload\n\n### Show Logs\n\n    docker logs -f pyload\n\n### Docker Compose\n\nCompatible with `docker-compose` v2 schemas:\n\n    ---\n    version: '2'\n    services:\n      pyload:\n        image: pyload\n        build: <REPODIR>\n        container_name: pyload\n        environment:\n          -

The CT version is not currently planned.\n\nDevelopment\n===========\n\nDependencies:\n-------------\n\n- Python 3 (tested mainly on CPython 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12; and on PyPy\n  7.3.12)\n\n- cffi_\n\n  - Transitive non-PyPI build-time dependency: `Python Headers`_ (only Linux users\n    need to manually install these; they come OOtB on Windows. Not sure about Mac.)\n\n- setuptools_ (build-time dependency)\n\n- wheel_ (build-time dependency)\n\n- a C compiler (build-time dependency)\n\n  - If you're on Windows, https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/\n\n    - If setuptools is having trouble finding your compiler, make sure to\n      first enter the appropriate environment. (For AMD64, this will be\n      \"x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022\"; for 32-bit x86, this\n      will be \"Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022\"; for other situations,\n      see `the documentation <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/building-on-the-command-line?view=msvc-170>`_.)\n\n  - If you're on Mac,\n    `reportedly Homebrew is a good choice <https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#macos-x>`_.\n\n    - It looks like you will also need ``pkgconfig`` and ``libffi``, ideally\n      installed via Homebrew, to build this.\n\n  - If you're on Linux, install build-essential_ or `'Development Tools'`_ or\n    something like that.\n\n  - (I haven't tested it, but if you're allergic to installing things outside\n    the venv you might be able to use\n    `this C compiler <https://pypi.org/project/ziglang/>`_...)\n\nGetting started:\n----------------\n\n0. Maybe `use a venv <https://www.bitecode.dev/p/relieving-your-python-packaging-pain>`_\n   or whatever if you want to\n\n   - for Windows: ``py -m venv .venv & .venv\\Scripts\\activate.bat``\n\n   - for Linux and Mac: ``python3 -m venv .venv; . .venv/bin/activate``\n     (first `install it <https://packages.ubuntu.com/jammy/python/python3-venv>`_,\n     if needed)\n\n1. Run ``python -m pip install .``\n\n   - Alternatively: you may get cleaner building with ``python -m build .``\n     (only after ``python -m pip install build``)\n\n   - Editable / \"develop\" mode not supported currently (CFFI will have to\n     `support this <https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/extension.html#setuptools.command.build.SubCommand.editable_mode>`_\n     before it's even on the table.)\n\n     - If you get error 1104 when trying to compile, make a folder ``C:\\temp``, then try ``set \"TMPDIR=C:\\temp\"`` and try again. (https://discuss.python.org/t/-/44077/5)\n\n2. Run ``python -m pqc.demo`` to test it. If it prints \"OK\" and exits, the\n   functions are almost certainly not broken. (Ideally, run this from a\n   DIFFERENT directory, such as your home folder, so you can be sure it's\n   being imported properly and not being masked by the local copy.)\n\n   - N.B. / FIXME: this function is currently NOT a full test suite;\n     it only does a single encap-decap cycle with\n     the default implementation of mceliece6960119.\n     It does NOT test any other version of McEliece,\n     or any signature algorithm.\n\n\n.. _cffi: https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.16/\n.. _wheel: https://wheel.readthedocs.io/\n.. _setuptools: https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/stable/\n.. _`Python Headers`: https://packages.ubuntu.com/jammy/python3-dev\n.. _build-essential: https://packages.ubuntu.com/jammy/build-essential\n.. _`'Development Tools'`: https://git.rockylinux.org/rocky/comps/-/blob/e6c8f29a7686326a731ea72b6caa06dabc7801b5/comps-rocky-9-lh.xml#L2169\n\n.. _`McEliece Signatures`: https://inria.hal.science/inria-00072511\n.. _`Hybrid Encryption`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_encryption\n.. _`KEM-TRANS`: https://www.ietf.org/staging/draft-prat-perret-lamps-cms-pq-kem-00.html\n.. _`message encapsulation`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_Message_Syntax\n",

The **vantage6** technology enables to manage and deploy privacy enhancing technologies like Federated Learning (FL) and Multi-Party Computation (MPC). Please visit our [website (vantage6.ai)](https://vantage6.ai) to learn more!\n\nYou can find more (user) documentation at [readthedocs (docs.vantage6.ai)](https://docs.vantage6.ai). If you have any questions, suggestions or just want to chat about federated learning: join our [Discord (https://discord.gg/yAyFf6Y)](https://discord.gg/yAyFf6Y) channel.\n\n## Infrastructure overview\n\n![Vantage6 architecture overview](docs/images/overview-infrastructure.png)\n\n_A High level overview of the vantage6 infrastructure. Vantage6 has both a\nclient-server and peer-to-peer architecture. The client is used by the researcher to\ncreate (PET) computation requests. It is also used to manage users, organizations and\ncollaborations. The server contains users, organizations, collaborations, tasks and\ntheir results. It provides a central access point for both the clients and nodes. The\nnodes have access to privacy sensitive data and handle computation requests retrieved\nfrom the server. Computation request are executed as separate containers on the node.\nThese containers are connected to containers at other nodes by a VPN network._\n\n## :books: Quickstart\n\n### Requirements\n\nThe **vantage6** infrastructure is delivered in Docker images. To run these images, you\nneed to have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed. To install the\nlatest version of the vantage6 CLI, you need to have\n[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), we recommend using an environment manager\nlike [mini-conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).\n\nInstall the latest version of the vantage6 CLI by using:\n\n```bash\npip install vantage6\n```\n\nThis install the `v6` commands, which allows you to manage your nodes and servers. To view all available options, run:\n\n```bash\nv6 --help\n```\n\nFor example you can create a local test setup by using:\n\n```bash\nv6 dev create-demo-network\n```\n\nThis creates a local network with a server and two nodes. You can start the network by running:\n\n```bash\nv6 dev start-demo-network\n```\n\nThis will start the server and nodes in the background. You can view the logs by running:\n\n```bash\n# View node logs\nv6 node attach\n\n# View server logs\nv6 server attach\n```\n\nFrom here you can use the [vantage6-client](https://pypi.org/project/vantage6-client)\nto interact with the server. The demo network has a pre-configured organization with\nthe following credentials:\n\n- Username: `dev_admin`\n- Password: `password`\n\nFor example, you can create a new organization by running:\n\n```python\nfrom vantage6.client import Client\n\nclient = Client('http://127.0.0.1', 7601, '/api', log_level='debug')\nclient.authenticate('dev_admin', 'password')\nclient.setup_encryption(None)\n\nclient.organization.create(\n    name='My organization',\n    address1='My address',\n    address2='My address',\n    zipcode='1234AB',\n    country='The Netherlands',\n    domain='my-organization.com'\n)\n```\n\nYou can find more (user) documentation at\n[readthedocs (docs.vantage6.ai)](https://docs.vantage6.ai)\n\n## Project structure\n\n### PYPI packages\n\nThis repository is home to 6 PyPi packages:\n\n- [vantage6](https://pypi.org/project/vantage6) -> _CLI for managing node and server instances_\n- [vantage6-client](https://pypi.org/project/vantage6-client) -> _Python client for interacting with the vantage6-server_\n- [vantage6-algorithm-tools](https://pypi.org/project/vantage6-algorithm-tools) -> _Python tools to facilitate algorithm development_\n- [vantage6-node](https://pypi.org/project/vantage6-node) -> _Node application package_\n- [vantage6-server](https://pypi.org/project/vantage6-server) -> _Server application package_\n- [vantage6-algorithm-store](https://pypi.org/project/vantage6-algorithm-store) -> _Algorithm store application package_\n- [vantage6-common](https://pypi.org/project/vantage6-common) -> _Package with common vantage6 functions_\n- [vantage6-backend-common](https://pypi.org/project/vantage6-backend-common) -> _Package with functions common to central server and algorithm store_\n\n**Note that when using vantage6 you do not install the _server_ and _node_ packages. These are delivered to you in Docker images.**\n\nThis repository also hosts the code for the vantage6 user interface (UI). The UI\nis an Angular web application that can be used to interact with the vantage6 server\neasily.\n\n### Docker images\n\nThe vantage6 infrastructure is delivered in Docker images. All Docker images are stored\nin our private [Harbor](https://goharbor.io/) registry. The most important images are:\n\n- `harbor2.vantage6.ai/infrastructure/node:VERSION` -> _Node application Docker image_\n- `harbor2.vantage6.ai/infrastructure/server:VERSION` -> _Server application Docker image_\n- `harbor2.vantage6.ai/infrastructure/ui:VERSION` -> _User interface Docker image_\n- `harbor2.vantage6.ai/infrastructure/algorithm-store:VERSION` -> _Algorithm store Docker image_\n\nwith `VERSION` being the full semantic version of the vantage6 infrastructure, e.g.\n`4.0.0` or `4.1.0rc0`.\n\nSeveral other images are used to support the infrastructure:\n\n- `harbor2.vantage6.ai/infrastructure/infrastructure-base:VERSION` -> _Base image for the infrastructure_\n- `harbor2.vantage6.ai/infrastructure/squid:VERSION` -> _Squid proxy image used for the whitelisting service_\n- `harbor2.vantage6.ai/infrastructure/alpine` -> _Alpine image used for vpn traffic forwarding_\n- `harbor2.vantage6.ai/infrastructure/vpn-client` -> _VPN image used to connect to the VPN_\n- `harbor2.vantage6.ai/infrastructure/vpn-configurator` -> _VPN image used for initialization_\n- `harbor2.vantage6.ai/infrastructure/ssh-tunnel` -> _SSH tunnel image used for connecting algorithms to external services_\n\nAnd finally there are some images released for algorithm development:\n\n- `harbor2.vantage6.ai/infrastructure/algorithm-base:MAJOR.MINOR` -> _Base image for algorithm development_\n- `harbor2.vantage6.ai/infrastructure/algorithm-ohdsi-base:MAJOR.MINOR` -> _Extended algorithm base image for OHDSI algorithm development_\n\n## :gift_heart: Join the community!\n\nWe hope to continue developing, improving, and supporting **vantage6** with the help of\nthe federated learning community.

It contains a set of technologies that\nenable data systems to efficiently store, process, and move data.\n\nMajor components of the project include:\n\n - [The Arrow Columnar In-Memory Format](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/format/Columnar.html):\n   a standard and efficient in-memory representation of various datatypes, plain or nested\n - [The Arrow IPC Format](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/format/Columnar.html#serialization-and-interprocess-communication-ipc):\n   an efficient serialization of the Arrow format and associated metadata,\n   for communication between processes and heterogeneous environments\n - [The Arrow Flight RPC protocol](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/main/format/Flight.proto):\n   based on the Arrow IPC format, a building block for remote services exchanging\n   Arrow data with application-defined semantics (for example a storage server or a database)\n - [C++ libraries](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/main/cpp)\n - [C bindings using GLib](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/main/c_glib)\n - [C# .NET libraries](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/main/csharp)\n - [Gandiva](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/main/cpp/src/gandiva):\n   an [LLVM](https://llvm.org)-based Arrow expression compiler, part of the C++ codebase\n - [Go libraries](https://github.com/apache/arrow-go)\n - [Java libraries](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/main/java)\n - [JavaScript libraries](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/main/js)\n - [Python libraries](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/main/python)\n - [R libraries](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/main/r)\n - [Ruby libraries](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/main/ruby)\n - [Rust libraries](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs)\n\nArrow is an [Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org) project. Learn more at\n[arrow.apache.org](https://arrow.apache.org).\n\n## What's in the Arrow libraries?\n\nThe reference Arrow libraries contain many distinct software components:\n\n- Columnar vector and table-like containers (similar to data frames) supporting\n  flat or nested types\n- Fast, language agnostic metadata messaging layer (using Google's Flatbuffers\n  library)\n- Reference-counted off-heap buffer memory management, for zero-copy memory\n  sharing and handling memory-mapped files\n- IO interfaces to local and remote filesystems\n- Self-describing binary wire formats (streaming and batch/file-like) for\n  remote procedure calls (RPC) and interprocess communication (IPC)\n- Integration tests for verifying binary compatibility between the\n  implementations (e.g. sending data from Java to C++)\n- Conversions to and from other in-memory data structures\n- Readers and writers for various widely-used file formats (such as Parquet, CSV)\n\n## Implementation status\n\nThe official Arrow libraries in this repository are in different stages of\nimplementing the Arrow format and related features.  See our current\n[feature matrix](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/status.html)\non git main.\n\n## How to Contribute\n\nPlease read our latest [project contribution guide][5].\n\n## Getting involved\n\nEven if you do not plan to contribute to Apache Arrow itself or Arrow\nintegrations in other projects, we'd be happy to have you involved:\n\n- Join the mailing list: send an email to\n  [dev-subscribe@arrow.apache.org][1]. Share your ideas and use cases for the\n  project.\n- Follow our activity on [GitHub issues][3]\n- [Learn the format][2]\n- Contribute code to one of the reference implementations\n\n[1]: mailto:dev-subscribe@arrow.apache.org\n[2]: https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/main/format\n[3]: https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues\n[4]: https://github.com/apache/arrow\n[5]: https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/developers/index.html\n",

install through [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/copyparty/): `python3 -m pip install --user -U copyparty`\n* or if you cannot install python, you can use [copyparty.exe](#copypartyexe) instead\n* or install [on arch](#arch-package) ╱ [on NixOS](#nixos-module) ╱ [through nix](#nix-package)\n* or if you are on android, [install copyparty in termux](#install-on-android)\n* or if your computer is messed up and nothing else works, [try the pyz](#zipapp)\n* or if you prefer to [use docker](./scripts/docker/) 🐋 you can do that too\n  * docker has all deps built-in, so skip this step:\n\nenable thumbnails (images/audio/video), media indexing, and audio transcoding by installing some recommended deps:\n\n* **Alpine:** `apk add py3-pillow ffmpeg`\n* **Debian:** `apt install --no-install-recommends python3-pil ffmpeg`\n* **Fedora:** rpmfusion + `dnf install python3-pillow ffmpeg --allowerasing`\n* **FreeBSD:** `pkg install py39-sqlite3 py39-pillow ffmpeg`\n* **MacOS:** `port install py-Pillow ffmpeg`\n* **MacOS** (alternative): `brew install pillow ffmpeg`\n* **Windows:** `python -m pip install --user -U Pillow`\n  * install python and ffmpeg manually; do not use `winget` or `Microsoft Store` (it breaks $PATH)\n  * copyparty.exe comes with `Pillow` and only needs `ffmpeg`\n* see [optional dependencies](#optional-dependencies) to enable even more features\n\nrunning copyparty without arguments (for example doubleclicking it on Windows) will give everyone read/write access to the current folder; you may want [accounts and volumes](#accounts-and-volumes)\n\nor see [some usage examples](#complete-examples) for inspiration, or the [complete windows example](./docs/examples/windows.md)\n\nsome recommended options:\n* `-e2dsa` enables general [file indexing](#file-indexing)\n* `-e2ts` enables audio metadata indexing (needs either FFprobe or Mutagen)\n* `-v /mnt/music:/music:r:rw,foo -a foo:bar` shares `/mnt/music` as `/music`, `r`eadable by anyone, and read-write for user `foo`, password `bar`\n  * replace `:r:rw,foo` with `:r,foo` to only make the folder readable by `foo` and nobody else\n  * see [accounts and volumes](#accounts-and-volumes) (or `--help-accounts`) for the syntax and other permissions\n\n\n### at home\n\nmake it accessible over the internet  by starting a [cloudflare quicktunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/do-more-with-tunnels/trycloudflare/) like so:\n\nfirst download [cloudflared](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/downloads/) and then start the tunnel with `cloudflared tunnel --url http://127.0.0.1:3923`\n\nas the tunnel starts, it will show a URL which you can share to let anyone browse your stash or upload files to you\n\nsince people will be connecting through cloudflare, run copyparty with `--xff-hdr cf-connecting-ip` to detect client IPs correctly\n\n\n### on servers\n\nyou may also want these, especially on servers:\n\n* [contrib/systemd/copyparty.service](contrib/systemd/copyparty.service) to run copyparty as a systemd service (see guide inside)\n* [contrib/systemd/prisonparty.service](contrib/systemd/prisonparty.service) to run it in a chroot (for extra security)\n* [contrib/openrc/copyparty](contrib/openrc/copyparty) to run copyparty on Alpine / Gentoo\n* [contrib/rc/copyparty](contrib/rc/copyparty) to run copyparty on FreeBSD\n* [nixos module](#nixos-module) to run copyparty on NixOS hosts\n* [contrib/nginx/copyparty.conf](contrib/nginx/copyparty.conf) to [reverse-proxy](#reverse-proxy) behind nginx (for better https)\n\nand remember to open the ports you want; here's a complete example including every feature copyparty has to offer:\n```\nfirewall-cmd --permanent --add-port={80,443,3921,3923,3945,3990}/tcp  # --zone=libvirt\nfirewall-cmd --permanent

🤙\n\n\n## testimonials\n\nsmall collection of user feedback\n\n`good enough`, `surprisingly correct`, `certified good software`, `just works`, `why`, `wow this is better than nextcloud`\n\n\n# motivations\n\nproject goals / philosophy\n\n* inverse linux philosophy -- do all the things, and do an *okay* job\n  * quick drop-in service to get a lot of features in a pinch\n  * some of [the alternatives](./docs/versus.md) might be a better fit for you\n* run anywhere, support everything\n  * as many web-browsers and python versions as possible\n    * every browser should at least be able to browse, download, upload files\n    * be a good emergency solution for transferring stuff between ancient boxes\n  * minimal dependencies\n    * but optional dependencies adding bonus-features are ok\n    * everything being plaintext makes it possible to proofread for malicious code\n  * no preparations / setup necessary, just run the sfx (which is also plaintext)\n* adaptable, malleable, hackable\n  * no build steps; modify the js/python without needing node.js or anything like that\n\n\n## notes\n\ngeneral notes:\n* paper-printing is affected by dark/light-mode! use lightmode for color, darkmode for grayscale\n  * because no browsers currently implement the media-query to do this properly orz\n\nbrowser-specific:\n* iPhone/iPad: use Firefox to download files\n* Android-Chrome: increase \"parallel uploads\" for higher speed (android bug)\n* Android-Firefox: takes a while to select files (their fix for ☝️)\n* Desktop-Firefox: ~~may use gigabytes of RAM if your files are massive~~ *seems to be OK now*\n* Desktop-Firefox: [may stop you from unplugging USB flashdrives](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1792598) until you visit `about:memory` and click `Minimize memory usage`\n\nserver-os-specific:\n* RHEL8 / Rocky8: you can run copyparty using `/usr/libexec/platform-python`\n\nserver notes:\n* pypy is supported but regular cpython is faster if you enable the database\n\n\n# bugs\n\nroughly sorted by chance of encounter\n\n* general:\n  * `--th-ff-jpg` may fix video thumbnails on some FFmpeg versions (macos, some linux)\n  * `--th-ff-swr` may fix audio thumbnails on some FFmpeg versions\n  * if the `up2k.db` (filesystem index) is on a samba-share or network disk, you'll get unpredictable behavior if the share is disconnected for a bit\n    * use `--hist` or the `hist` volflag (`-v [...]:c,hist=/tmp/foo`) to place the db on a local disk instead\n  * all volumes must exist / be available on startup; up2k (mtp especially) gets funky otherwise\n  * probably more, pls let me know\n\n* python 3.4 and older (including 2.7):\n  * many rare and exciting edge-cases because [python didn't handle EINTR yet](https://peps.python.org/pep-0475/)\n    * downloads from copyparty may suddenly fail, but uploads *should* be fine\n\n* python 2.7 on Windows:\n  * cannot index non-ascii filenames with `-e2d`\n  * cannot handle filenames with mojibake\n\nif you have a new exciting bug to share, see [reporting bugs](#reporting-bugs)\n\n\n## not my bugs\n\nsame order here too\n\n* [Chrome issue 1317069](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1317069) -- if you try to upload a folder which contains symlinks by dragging it into the browser, the symlinked files will not get uploaded\n\n* [Chrome issue 1352210](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1352210) -- plaintext http may be faster at filehashing than https (but also extremely CPU-intensive)\n\n* [Firefox issue 1790500](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1790500) -- entire browser can crash after uploading ~4000 small files\n\n* Android: music playback randomly stops due to [battery usage settings](#fix-unreliable-playback-on-android)\n\n* iPhones: the volume control doesn't work because [apple doesn't want it to](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/Using_HTML5_Audio_Video/Device-SpecificConsiderations/Device-SpecificConsiderations.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009523-CH5-SW11)\n  * `AudioContext` will probably never be a viable workaround as apple introduces new issues faster than they fix current ones\n\n* iPhones: the preload feature (in the media-player-options tab) can cause a tiny audio glitch 20sec before the end of each song, but disabling it may cause worse iOS bugs to appear instead\n  * just a hunch, but disabling preloading may cause playback to stop entirely, or possibly mess with bluetooth speakers\n  * tried to add a tooltip regarding this but looks like apple broke my tooltips\n\n* Windows: folders cannot be accessed if the name ends with `.`\n  * python or windows bug\n\n* Windows: msys2-python 3.8.6 occasionally throws `RuntimeError: release unlocked lock` when leaving a scoped mutex in up2k\n  * this is an msys2 bug, the regular windows edition of python is fine\n\n* VirtualBox: sqlite throws `Disk I/O Error` when running in a VM and the up2k database is in a vboxsf\n  * use `--hist` or the `hist` volflag (`-v [...]:c,hist=/tmp/foo`) to place the db inside the vm instead\n  * also happens on mergerfs, so put the db elsewhere\n\n* Ubuntu: dragging files from certain folders into firefox or chrome is impossible\n  * due to snap security policies -- see `snap connections firefox` for the allowlist, `removable-media` permits all of `/mnt` and `/media` apparently\n\n\n# breaking changes\n\nupgrade notes\n\n* `1.9.16` (2023-11-04):\n  * `--stats`/prometheus: `cpp_bans` renamed to `cpp_active_bans`, and that + `cpp_uptime` are gauges\n* `1.6.0` (2023-01-29):\n  * http-api: delete/move is now `POST` instead of `GET`\n  * everything other than `GET` and `HEAD` must pass [cors validation](#cors)\n* `1.5.0` (2022-12-03): [new chunksize formula](https://github.com/9001/copyparty/commit/54e1c8d261df) for files larger than 128 GiB\n  * **users:** upgrade to the latest [cli uploader](https://github.com/9001/copyparty/blob/hovudstraum/bin/u2c.py) if you use that\n  * **devs:** update third-party up2k clients (if those even exist)\n\n\n# FAQ\n\n\"frequently\" asked questions\n\n* is it possible to block read-access to folders unless you know the exact URL for a particular file inside?\n  * yes, using the [`g` permission](#accounts-and-volumes), see the examples there\n  * you can also do this with linux filesystem permissions; `chmod 111 music` will make it possible to access files and folders inside the `music` folder but not list the immediate contents -- also works with other software, not just copyparty\n\n* can I link someone to a password-protected volume/file by including the password in the URL?\n  * yes, by adding `?pw=hunter2` to the end; replace `?` with `&` if there are parameters in the URL already, meaning it contains a `?` near the end\n\n* how do I stop `.hist` folders from appearing everywhere on my HDD?\n  * by default, a `.hist` folder is created inside each volume for the filesystem index, thumbnails, audio transcodes, and markdown document history. Use the `--hist` global-option or the `hist` volflag to move it somewhere else; see [database location](#database-location)\n\n* can I make copyparty download a file to my server if I give it a URL?\n  * yes, using [hooks](https://github.com/9001/copyparty/blob/hovudstraum/bin/hooks/wget.py)\n\n* firefox refuses to connect over https, saying \"Secure Connection Failed\" or \"SEC_ERROR_BAD_SIGNATURE\", but the usual button to \"Accept the Risk and Continue\" is not shown\n  * firefox has corrupted its certstore; fix this by exiting firefox, then find and delete the file named `cert9.db` somewhere in your firefox profile folder\n\n* the server keeps saying `thank you for playing` when I try to access the website\n  * you've gotten banned for malicious traffic! if this happens by mistake, and you're running a reverse-proxy and/or something like cloudflare, see [real-ip](#real-ip) on how to fix this\n\n* copyparty seems to think I am using http, even though the URL is https\n  * your reverse-proxy is not sending the `X-Forwarded-Proto: https` header; this could be because your reverse-proxy itself is confused. Ensure that none of the intermediates (such as cloudflare) are terminating https before the traffic hits your entrypoint\n\n* i want to learn python and/or programming and am considering looking at the copyparty source code in that occasion\n  * ```bash\n     _|  _      __   _  _|_\n    (_| (_)     | | (_)  |_\n    ```\n\n\n# accounts and volumes\n\nper-folder, per-user permissions  - if your setup is getting complex, consider making a [config file](./docs/example.conf) instead of using arguments\n* much easier to manage, and you can modify the config at runtime with `systemctl reload copyparty` or more conveniently using the `[reload cfg]` button in the control-panel (if the user has `a`/admin in any volume)\n  * changes to the `[global]` config section requires a restart to take effect\n\na quick summary can be seen using `--help-accounts`\n\nconfiguring accounts/volumes with arguments:\n* `-a usr:pwd` adds account `usr` with password `pwd`\n* `-v .::r` adds current-folder `.` as the webroot, `r`eadable by anyone\n  * the syntax is `-v src:dst:perm:perm:...` so local-path, url-path, and one or more permissions to set\n  * granting the same permissions to multiple accounts:  \n    `-v .::r,usr1,usr2:rw,usr3,usr4` = usr1/2 read-only, 3/4 read-write\n\npermissions:\n* `r` (read): browse folder contents, download files, download as zip/tar, see filekeys/dirkeys\n* `w` (write): upload files, move files *into* this folder\n* `m` (move): move files/folders *from* this folder\n* `d` (delete): delete files/folders\n* `.` (dots): user can ask to show dotfiles in directory listings\n* `g` (get): only download files, cannot see folder contents or zip/tar\n* `G` (upget): same as `g` except uploaders get to see their own [filekeys](#filekeys) (see `fk` in examples below)\n* `h` (html): same as `g` except folders return their index.html, and filekeys are not necessary for index.html\n* `a` (admin): can see upload time, uploader IPs, config-reload\n* `A` (\"all\"): same as `rwmda.` (read/write/move/delete/admin/dotfiles)\n\nexamples:\n* add accounts named u1, u2, u3 with passwords p1, p2, p3: `-a u1:p1 -a u2:p2 -a u3:p3`\n* make folder `/srv` the root of the filesystem, read-only by anyone: `-v /srv::r`\n* make folder `/mnt/music` available at `/music`, read-only for u1 and u2, read-write for u3: `-v /mnt/music:music:r,u1,u2:rw,u3`\n  * unauthorized users accessing the webroot can see that the `music` folder exists, but cannot open it\n* make folder `/mnt/incoming` available at `/inc`, write-only for u1, read-move for u2: `-v /mnt/incoming:inc:w,u1:rm,u2`\n  * unauthorized users accessing the webroot can see that the `inc` folder exists, but cannot open it\n  * `u1` can open the `inc` folder, but cannot see the contents, only upload new files to it\n  * `u2` can browse it and move files *from* `/inc` into any folder where `u2` has write-access\n* make folder `/mnt/ss` available at `/i`, read-write for u1, get-only for everyone else, and enable filekeys: `-v /mnt/ss:i:rw,u1:g:c,fk=4`\n  * `c,fk=4` sets the `fk` ([filekey](#filekeys)) volflag to 4, meaning each file gets a 4-character accesskey\n  * `u1` can upload files, browse the folder, and see the generated filekeys\n  * other users cannot browse the folder, but can access the files if they have the full file URL with the filekey\n  * replacing the `g` permission with `wg` would let anonymous users upload files, but not see the required filekey to access it\n  * replacing the `g` permission with `wG` would let anonymous users upload files, receiving a working direct link in return\n\nanyone trying to bruteforce a password gets banned according to `--ban-pw`; default is 24h ban for 9 failed attempts in 1 hour\n\n\n## shadowing\n\nhiding specific subfolders  by mounting another volume on top of them\n\nfor example `-v /mnt::r -v /var/empty:web/certs:r` mounts the server folder `/mnt` as the webroot, but another volume is mounted at `/web/certs` -- so visitors can only see the contents of `/mnt` and `/mnt/web` (at URLs `/` and `/web`), but not `/mnt/web/certs` because URL `/web/certs` is mapped to `/var/empty`\n\n\n## dotfiles\n\nunix-style hidden files/folders  by starting the name with a dot\n\nanyone can access these if they know the name, but they normally don't appear in directory listings\n\na client can request to see dotfiles in directory listings if global option `-ed` is specified, or the volume has volflag `dots`, or the user has permission `.`\n\ndotfiles do not appear in search results unless one of the above is true, **and** the global option / volflag `dotsrch` is set\n\n\n# the browser\n\naccessing a copyparty server using a

FFmpeg for video files, so you may want to `--no-thumb` or maybe just `--no-vthumb` depending on how dangerous your users are\n* pyvips is 3x faster than Pillow, Pillow is 3x faster than FFmpeg\n* disable thumbnails for specific volumes with volflag `dthumb` for all, or `dvthumb` / `dathumb` / `dithumb` for video/audio/images only\n\naudio files are converted into spectrograms using FFmpeg unless you `--no-athumb` (and some FFmpeg builds may need `--th-ff-swr`)\n\nimages with the following names (see `--th-covers`) become the thumbnail of the folder they're in: `folder.png`, `folder.jpg`, `cover.png`, `cover.jpg`\n* the order is significant, so if both `cover.png` and `folder.jpg` exist in a folder, it will pick the first matching `--th-covers` entry (`folder.jpg`)\n* and, if you enable [file indexing](#file-indexing), it will also try those names as dotfiles (`.folder.jpg` and so), and then fallback on the first picture in the folder (if it has any pictures at all)\n\nenabling `multiselect` lets you click files to select them, and then shift-click another file for range-select\n* `multiselect` is mostly intended for phones/tablets, but the `sel` option in the `[⚙️] settings` tab is better suited for desktop use, allowing selection by CTRL-clicking and range-selection with SHIFT-click, all without affecting regular clicking\n  * the `sel` option can be made default globally with `--gsel` or per-volume with volflag `gsel`\n\n\n## zip downloads\n\ndownload folders (or file selections) as `zip` or `tar` files\n\nselect which type of archive you want in the `[⚙️] config` tab:\n\n| name | url-suffix | description |\n|--|--|--|\n| `tar` | `?tar` | plain gnutar, works great with `curl \\| tar -xv` |\n| `pax` | `?tar=pax` | pax-format tar, futureproof, not as fast |\n| `tgz` | `?tar=gz` | gzip compressed gnu-tar (slow), for `curl \\| tar -xvz` |\n| `txz` | `?tar=xz` | gnu-tar with xz / lzma compression (v.slow) |\n| `zip` | `?zip=utf8` | works everywhere, glitchy filenames on win7 and older |\n| `zip_dos` | `?zip` | traditional cp437 (no unicode) to fix glitchy filenames |\n| `zip_crc` | `?zip=crc` | cp437 with crc32 computed early for truly ancient software |\n\n* gzip default level is `3` (0=fast, 9=best), change with `?tar=gz:9`\n* xz default level is `1` (0=fast, 9=best), change with `?tar=xz:9`\n* bz2 default level is `2` (1=fast, 9=best), change with `?tar=bz2:9`\n* hidden files ([dotfiles](#dotfiles)) are excluded unless account is allowed to list them\n  * `up2k.db` and `dir.txt` is always excluded\n* bsdtar supports streaming unzipping: `curl foo?zip=utf8 | bsdtar -xv`\n  * good, because copyparty's zip is faster than tar on small files\n* `zip_crc` will take longer to download since the server has to read each file twice\n  * this is only to support MS-DOS PKZIP v2.04g (october 1993) and older\n    * how are you accessing copyparty actually\n\nyou can also zip a selection of files or folders by clicking them in the browser, that brings up a selection editor and zip button in the bottom right\n\n![copyparty-zipsel-fs8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/241032/129635374-e5136e01-470a-49b1-a762-848e8a4c9cdc.png)\n\ncool trick: download a folder by appending url-params `?tar&opus` or `?tar&mp3` to transcode all audio files (except aac|m4a|mp3|ogg|opus|wma) to opus/mp3 before they're added to the archive\n* super useful if you're 5 minutes away from takeoff and realize you don't have any music on your phone but your server only has flac files and downloading those will burn through all your data + there wouldn't be enough time anyways\n* and url-params `&j` / `&w` produce jpeg/webm thumbnails/spectrograms instead of the original audio/video/images (`&p` for audio waveforms)\n  * can also be used to pregenerate thumbnails; combine with `--th-maxage=9999999` or `--th-clean=0`\n\n\n## uploading\n\ndrag files/folders into the web-browser to upload\n\ndragdrop is the recommended way, but you may also:\n\n* select some files (not folders) in your file explorer and press CTRL-V inside the browser window\n* use the [command-line uploader](https://github.com/9001/copyparty/tree/hovudstraum/bin#u2cpy)\n* upload using [curl or sharex](#client-examples)\n\nwhen uploading files through dragdrop or CTRL-V, this initiates an upload using `up2k`; there are two browser-based uploaders available:\n* `[🎈] bup`, the basic uploader, supports almost every browser since netscape 4.0\n* `[🚀] up2k`, the good / fancy one\n\nNB: you can undo/delete your own uploads with `[🧯]` [unpost](#unpost) (and this is also where you abort unfinished uploads, but you have to refresh the page first)\n\nup2k has several advantages:\n* you can drop folders into the browser (files are added recursively)\n* files are processed in chunks, and each chunk is checksummed\n  * uploads autoresume if they are interrupted by network issues\n  * uploads resume if you reboot your browser or pc, just upload the same files again\n  * server detects any corruption; the client reuploads affected chunks\n  * the client doesn't upload anything that already exists on the server\n  * no filesize limit, even when a proxy limits the request size (for example Cloudflare)\n* much higher speeds than ftp/scp/tarpipe on some internet connections (mainly american ones) thanks to parallel connections\n* the last-modified timestamp of the file is preserved\n\n> it is perfectly safe to restart / upgrade copyparty while someone is uploading to it!  \n> all known up2k clients will resume just fine 💪\n\nsee [up2k](./docs/devnotes.md#up2k) for details on how it works, or watch a [demo video](https://a.ocv.me/pub/demo/pics-vids/#gf-0f6f5c0d)\n\n![copyparty-upload-fs8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/241032/129635371-48fc54ca-fa91-48e3-9b1d-ba413e4b68cb.png)\n\n**protip:** you can avoid scaring away users with [contrib/plugins/minimal-up2k.js](contrib/plugins/minimal-up2k.js) which makes it look [much simpler](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/241032/118311195-dd6ca380-b4ef-11eb-86f3-75a3ff2e1332.png)\n\n**protip:** if you enable `favicon` in the `[⚙️] settings` tab (by typing something into the textbox), the icon in the browser tab will indicate upload progress -- also, the `[🔔]` and/or `[🔊]` switches enable visible and/or audible notifications on upload completion\n\nthe up2k UI is the epitome of polished intuitive experiences:\n* \"parallel uploads\" specifies how many chunks to upload at the same time\n* `[🏃]` analysis of other files should continue while one is uploading\n* `[🥔]` shows a simpler UI for faster uploads from slow devices\n* `[🎲]` generate random filenames during upload\n* `[📅]` preserve last-modified timestamps; server times will match yours\n* `[🔎]` switch between upload and [file-search](#file-search) mode\n  * ignore `[🔎]` if you add files by dragging them into the browser\n\nand then theres the tabs below it,\n* `[ok]` is the files which completed successfully\n* `[ng]` is the ones that failed / got rejected (already exists, ...)\n* `[done]` shows a combined list of `[ok]` and `[ng]`, chronological order\n* `[busy]` files which are currently hashing, pending-upload, or uploading\n  * plus up to 3 entries each from `[done]` and `[que]` for context\n* `[que]` is all the files that are still queued\n\nnote that since up2k has to read each file twice, `[🎈] bup` can *theoretically* be up to 2x faster in some extreme cases (files bigger than your ram, combined with an internet connection faster than the read-speed of your HDD, or if you're uploading from a cuo2duo)\n\nif you are resuming a massive upload and want to skip hashing the files which already finished, you can enable `turbo` in the `[⚙️] config` tab, but please read the tooltip on that button\n\nif the server is behind a proxy which imposes a request-size limit, you can configure up2k to sneak below the limit with server-option `--u2sz` (the default is 96 MiB to support Cloudflare)\n\n\n### file-search\n\ndropping files into the browser also lets you see if they exist on the server\n\n![copyparty-fsearch-fs8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/241032/129635361-c79286f0-b8f1-440e-aaf4-6e929428fac9.png)\n\nwhen you drag/drop files into the browser, you will see two dropzones: `Upload` and `Search`\n\n> on a phone? toggle the `[🔎]` switch green before tapping the big yellow Search button to select your files\n\nthe files will be hashed on the client-side, and each hash is sent to the server, which checks if that file exists somewhere\n\nfiles go into `[ok]` if they exist (and you get a link to where it is), otherwise they land in `[ng]`\n* the main reason filesearch is combined with the uploader is cause the code was too spaghetti to separate it out somewhere else, this is no longer the case but now i've warmed up to the idea too much\n\n\n### unpost\n\nundo/delete accidental uploads\n\n![copyparty-unpost-fs8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/241032/129635368-3afa6634-c20f-418c-90dc-ec411f3b3897.png)\n\nyou can unpost even if you don't have regular move/delete access, however only for files uploaded within the past `--unpost` seconds (default 12 hours) and the server must be running with `-e2d`\n\n\n### self-destruct\n\nuploads can be given a lifetime,  after which they expire / self-destruct\n\nthe feature must be enabled per-volume with the `lifetime` [upload rule](#upload-rules) which sets the upper limit for how long a file gets to stay on the server\n\nclients can specify a shorter expiration time using the [up2k ui](#uploading) -- the relevant options become visible upon navigating into a folder with `lifetimes` enabled -- or by using the `life` [upload modifier](./docs/devnotes.md#write)\n\nspecifying a custom expiration time client-side will affect the timespan in which unposts are permitted, so keep an eye on the estimates in the up2k ui\n\n\n### race the beam\n\ndownload files while they're still uploading ([demo video](http://a.ocv.me/pub/g/nerd-stuff/cpp/2024-0418-race-the-beam.webm))  -- it's almost like peer-to-peer\n\nrequires the file to be uploaded using up2k (which is the default drag-and-drop uploader), alternatively the command-line program\n\n\n### incoming files\n\nthe control-panel shows the ETA for all incoming files  , but only for files being uploaded into volumes where you have read-access\n\n![copyparty-cpanel-upload-eta-or8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd275ffa-698c-4fca-a307-4d2181269a6a)\n\n\n## file manager\n\ncut/paste, rename, and delete files/folders

across browser tabs (cut in one tab, paste in another)\n\n\n## shares\n\nshare a file or folder by creating a temporary link\n\nwhen enabled in the server settings (`--shr`), click the bottom-right `share` button to share the folder you're currently in, or alternatively:\n* select a folder first to share that folder instead\n* select one or more files to share only those files\n\nthis feature was made with [identity providers](#identity-providers) in mind -- configure your reverseproxy to skip the IdP's access-control for a given URL prefix and use that to safely share specific files/folders sans the usual auth checks\n\nwhen creating a share, the creator can choose any of the following options:\n\n* password-protection\n* expire after a certain time; `0` or blank means infinite\n* allow visitors to upload (if the user who creates the share has write-access)\n\nsemi-intentional limitations:\n\n* cleanup of expired shares only works when global option `e2d` is set, and/or at least one volume on the server has volflag `e2d`\n* only folders from the same volume are shared; if you are sharing a folder which contains other volumes, then the contents of those volumes will not be available\n* related to [IdP volumes being forgotten on shutdown](https://github.com/9001/copyparty/blob/hovudstraum/docs/idp.md#idp-volumes-are-forgotten-on-shutdown), any shares pointing into a user's IdP volume will be unavailable until that user makes their first request after a restart\n* no option to \"delete after first access\" because tricky\n  * when linking something to discord (for example) it'll get accessed by their scraper and that would count as a hit\n  * browsers wouldn't be able to resume a broken download unless the requester's IP gets allowlisted for X minutes (ref. tricky)\n\nspecify `--shr /foobar` to enable this feature; a toplevel virtual folder named `foobar` is then created, and that's where all the shares will be served from\n\n* you can name it whatever, `foobar` is just an example\n* if you're using config files, put `shr: /foobar` inside the `[global]` section instead\n\nusers can delete their own shares in the controlpanel, and a list of privileged users (`--shr-adm`) are allowed to see and/or delet any share on the server\n\nafter a share has expired, it remains visible in the controlpanel for `--shr-rt` minutes (default is 1 day), and the owner can revive it by extending the expiration time there\n\n**security note:** using this feature does not mean that you can skip the [accounts and volumes](#accounts-and-volumes) section -- you still need to restrict access to volumes that you do not intend to share with unauthenticated users! it is not sufficient to use rules in the reverseproxy to restrict access to just the `/share` folder.\n\n\n## batch rename\n\nselect some files and press `F2` to bring up the rename UI\n\n![batch-rename-fs8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/241032/128434204-eb136680-3c07-4ec7-92e0-ae86af20c241.png)\n\nquick explanation of the buttons,  \n* `[✅ apply rename]` confirms and begins renaming\n* `[❌ cancel]` aborts and closes the rename window\n* `[↺ reset]` reverts any filename changes back to the original name\n* `[decode]` does a URL-decode on the filename, fixing stuff like `&amp;` and `%20`\n* `[advanced]` toggles advanced mode\n\nadvanced mode: rename files based on rules to decide the new names, based on the original name (regex), or based on the tags collected from the file (artist/title/...), or a mix of both\n\nin advanced mode,  \n* `[case]` toggles case-sensitive regex\n* `regex` is the regex pattern to apply to the original filename; any files which don't match will be skipped\n* `format` is the new filename, taking values from regex capturing groups and/or from file tags\n  * very loosely based on foobar2000 syntax\n* `presets` lets you save rename rules for later\n\navailable functions:\n* `$lpad(text, length, pad_char)`\n* `$rpad(text, length, pad_char)`\n\nso,\n\nsay you have a file named [`meganeko - Eclipse - 07 Sirius A.mp3`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dtb0vDPruI) (absolutely fantastic album btw) and the tags are: `Album:Eclipse`, `Artist:meganeko`, `Title:Sirius A`, `tn:7`\n\nyou could use just regex to rename it:\n* `regex` = `(.*) - (.*) - ([0-9]{2}) (.*)`\n* `format` = `(3). (1) - (4)`\n* `output` = `07. meganeko - Sirius A.mp3`\n\nor you could use just tags:\n* `format` = `$lpad((tn),2,0). (artist) - (title).(ext)`\n* `output` = `7. meganeko - Sirius A.mp3`\n\nor a mix of both:\n* `regex` = ` - ([0-9]{2}) `\n* `format` = `(1). (artist) - (title).(ext)`\n* `output` = `07. meganeko - Sirius A.mp3`\n\nthe metadata keys you can use in the format field are the ones in the file-browser table header (whatever is collected with `-mte` and `-mtp`)\n\n\n## rss feeds\n\nmonitor a folder with your RSS reader  , optionally recursive\n\nmust be enabled per-volume with volflag `rss` or globally with `--rss`\n\nthe feed includes itunes metadata for use with podcast readers such as [AntennaPod](https://antennapod.org/)\n\na feed example: https://cd.ocv.me/a/d2/d22/?rss&fext=mp3\n\nurl parameters:\n\n* `pw=hunter2` for password auth\n* `recursive` to also include subfolders\n* `title=foo` changes the feed title (default: folder name)\n* `fext=mp3,opus` only include mp3 and opus files (default: all)\n* `nf=30` only show the first 30 results (default: 250)\n* `sort=m` sort by mtime (file last-modified), newest first (default)\n  * `u` = upload-time; NOTE: non-uploaded files have upload-time `0`\n  * `n` = filename\n  * `a` = filesize\n  * uppercase = reverse-sort; `M` = oldest file first\n\n\n## media player\n\nplays almost every audio format there is  (if the server has FFmpeg installed for on-demand transcoding)\n\nthe following audio formats are usually always playable, even without FFmpeg: `aac|flac|m4a|mp3|ogg|opus|wav`\n\nsome hilights:\n* OS integration;

Please use `--smb-port` (see below) and [prisonparty](./bin/prisonparty.sh)\n  * account passwords work per-volume as expected, and so does account permissions (read/write/move/delete), but `--smbw` must be given to allow write-access from smb\n  * [shadowing](#shadowing) probably works as expected but no guarantees\n\nand some minor issues,\n* clients only see the first ~400 files in big folders;\n  * this was originally due to [impacket#1433](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/issues/1433) which was fixed in impacket-0.12, so you can disable the workaround with `--smb-nwa-1` but then you get unacceptably poor performance instead\n* hot-reload of server config (`/?reload=cfg`) does not include the `[global]` section (commandline args)\n* listens on the first IPv4 `-i` interface only (default = :: = 0.0.0.0 = all)\n* login doesn't work on winxp, but anonymous access is ok -- remove all accounts from copyparty config for that to work\n  * win10 onwards does not allow connecting anonymously / without accounts\n* python3 only\n* slow (the builtin webdav support in windows is 5x faster, and rclone-webdav is 30x faster)\n\nknown client bugs:\n* on win7 only, `--smb1` is much faster than smb2 (default) because it keeps rescanning folders on smb2\n  * however smb1 is buggy and is not enabled by default on win10 onwards\n* windows cannot access folders which contain filenames with invalid unicode or forbidden characters (`<>:\"/\\|?*`), or names ending with `.`\n\nthe smb protocol listens on TCP port 445, which is a privileged port on linux and macos, which would require running copyparty as root. However, this can be avoided by listening on another port using `--smb-port 3945` and then using NAT on the server to forward the traffic from 445 to there;\n* on linux: `iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 445 -j REDIRECT --to-port 3945`\n\nauthenticate with one of the following:\n* username `$username`, password `$password`\n* username `$password`, password `k`\n\n\n## browser ux\n\ntweaking the ui\n\n* set default sort order globally with `--sort` or per-volume with the `sort` volflag; specify one or more comma-separated columns to sort by, and prefix the column name with `-` for reverse sort\n  * the column names you can use are visible as tooltips when hovering over the column headers in the directory listing, for example `href ext sz ts tags/.up_at tags/Circle tags/.tn tags/Artist tags/Title`\n  * to sort in music order (album, track, artist, title) with filename as fallback, you could `--sort tags/Circle,tags/.tn,tags/Artist,tags/Title,href`\n  * to sort by upload date, first enable showing the upload date in the listing with `-e2d -mte +.up_at` and then `--sort tags/.up_at`\n\nsee [./docs/rice](./docs/rice) for more, including how to add stuff (css/`<meta>`/...) to the html `<head>` tag, or to add your own translation\n\n\n## opengraph\n\ndiscord and social-media embeds\n\ncan be enabled globally with `--og` or per-volume with volflag `og`\n\nnote that this disables hotlinking because the opengraph spec demands it; to sneak past this intentional limitation, you can enable opengraph selectively by user-agent, for example `--og-ua '(Discord|Twitter|Slack)bot'` (or volflag `og_ua`)\n\nyou can also hotlink files regardless by appending `?raw` to the url\n\nif you want to entirely replace the copyparty response with your own jinja2 template, give the template filepath to `--og-tpl` or volflag `og_tpl` (all members of `HttpCli` are available through the `this` object)\n\n\n## file deduplication\n\nenable symlink-based upload deduplication  globally with `--dedup` or per-volume with volflag `dedup`\n\nby default, when someone tries to upload a file that already exists on the server, the upload will be politely declined, and the server will copy the existing file over to where the upload would have gone\n\nif you enable deduplication with `--dedup` then it'll create a symlink instead of a full copy, thus reducing disk space usage\n\n* on the contrary, if your server is hooked up to s3-glacier or similar storage where reading is expensive, and you cannot use `--safe-dedup=1` because you have other software tampering with your files, so you want to entirely disable detection of duplicate data instead, then you can specify `--no-clone` globally or `noclone` as a volflag\n\n**warning:** when enabling dedup, you should also:\n* enable indexing with `-e2dsa` or volflag `e2dsa` (see [file indexing](#file-indexing) section below); strongly recommended\n* ...and/or `--hardlink-only` to use hardlink-based deduplication instead of symlinks; see explanation below\n\nit will not be safe to rename/delete files if you only enable dedup and none of the above; if you enable indexing then it is not *necessary* to also do hardlinks (but you may still want to)\n\nby default, deduplication is done based on symlinks (symbolic links); these are tiny files which are pointers to the nearest full copy of the file\n\nyou can choose to use hardlinks instead of softlinks, globally with `--hardlink-only` or volflag `hardlinkonly`;\n\nadvantages of using hardlinks:\n* hardlinks are more compatible with other software; they behave entirely like regular files\n* you can safely move and rename files using other file managers\n  * symlinks need to be managed by copyparty to ensure the destinations remain correct\n\nadvantages of using symlinks (default):\n* each symlink can have its own last-modified timestamp, but a single timestamp is shared by all hardlinks\n* symlinks make it more obvious to other software that the file is not a regular file, so this can be less dangerous\n  * hardlinks look like regular files, so other software may assume they are safe to edit without affecting the other copies\n\n**warning:** if you edit the contents of a deduplicated file, then you will also edit all other copies of that file! This is especially surprising with hardlinks, because they look like regular files, but that same file exists in multiple locations\n\nglobal-option `--xlink` / volflag `xlink` additionally enables deduplication across volumes, but this is probably buggy and not recommended\n\n\n\n## file indexing\n\nenable music search, upload-undo, and better dedup\n\nfile indexing relies on two database tables, the up2k filetree (`-e2d`) and the metadata tags (`-e2t`), stored in `.hist/up2k.db`. Configuration can be done through arguments, volflags, or a mix of both.\n\nthrough arguments:\n* `-e2d` enables file indexing on upload\n* `-e2ds` also scans writable folders for new files on startup\n* `-e2dsa` also scans all mounted volumes (including readonly ones)\n* `-e2t` enables metadata indexing on upload\n* `-e2ts` also scans for tags in all files that don't have tags yet\n* `-e2tsr` also deletes all existing tags, doing a full reindex\n* `-e2v` verifies file integrity at startup, comparing hashes from the db\n* `-e2vu` patches the database with the new hashes from the filesystem\n* `-e2vp` panics and kills copyparty instead\n\nthe same arguments can be set as volflags, in addition to `d2d`, `d2ds`, `d2t`, `d2ts`, `d2v` for disabling:\n* `-v ~/music::r:c,e2ds,e2tsr` does a full reindex of everything on startup\n* `-v ~/music::r:c,d2d` disables **all** indexing, even if any `-e2*` are on\n* `-v ~/music::r:c,d2t` disables all `-e2t*` (tags), does not affect `-e2d*`\n* `-v ~/music::r:c,d2ds` disables on-boot scans; only index new uploads\n* `-v ~/music::r:c,d2ts` same except only affecting tags\n\nnote:\n* upload-times can be displayed in the file listing by enabling the `.up_at` metadata key, either globally with `-e2d -mte +.up_at` or per-volume with volflags `e2d,mte=+.up_at` (will have a ~17% performance impact on directory listings)\n* `e2tsr` is probably always overkill, since `e2ds`/`e2dsa` would pick up any file modifications and `e2ts` would then reindex those, unless there is a new copyparty version with new parsers and the release note says otherwise\n* the rescan button in the admin panel has no effect unless the volume has `-e2ds` or higher\n\n### exclude-patterns\n\nto save some time,  you can provide a regex pattern for filepaths to only index by filename/path/size/last-modified (and not the hash of the file contents) by setting `--no-hash \\.iso$` or the volflag `:c,nohash=\\.iso$`, this has the following consequences:\n* initial indexing is way faster, especially when the volume is on a network disk\n* makes it impossible to [file-search](#file-search)\n* if someone uploads the same file contents, the upload will not be detected as a dupe, so it will not get symlinked or rejected\n\nsimilarly, you can fully ignore files/folders using `--no-idx [...]` and `:c,noidx=\\.iso$`\n\n* when running on macos, all the usual apple metadata files are excluded by default\n\nif you set `--no-hash [...]` globally, you can enable hashing for specific volumes using flag `:c,nohash=`\n\n### filesystem guards\n\navoid traversing into other filesystems  using `--xdev` / volflag `:c,xdev`, skipping any symlinks or bind-mounts to another HDD for example\n\nand/or you can `--xvol` / `:c,xvol` to ignore all symlinks leaving the volume's top directory, but still allow bind-mounts pointing elsewhere\n\n* symlinks are permitted with `xvol` if they point into another volume where the user has the same level of access\n\nthese options will reduce performance; unlikely worst-case estimates are 14% reduction for directory listings, 35% for download-as-tar\n\nas of copyparty v1.7.0 these options also prevent file access at runtime -- in previous versions it was just hints for the indexer\n\n### periodic rescan\n\nfilesystem monitoring;  if copyparty is not the only software doing stuff on your filesystem, you may want to enable periodic rescans to keep the index up to date\n\nargument `--re-maxage 60` will rescan all volumes every 60 sec, same as volflag `:c,scan=60` to specify it per-volume\n\nuploads are disabled while a rescan is happening, so rescans will be delayed by `--db-act` (default 10 sec) when there is write-activity going on (uploads, renames, ...)\n\n\n## upload rules\n\nset upload rules using volflags,  some examples:\n\n* `:c,sz=1k-3m` sets allowed filesize between 1 KiB and 3 MiB inclusive (suffixes: `b`, `k`, `m`, `g`)\n* `:c,df=4g` block uploads if there would be less than 4 GiB free disk space afterwards\n* `:c,vmaxb=1g` block uploads if total volume size would exceed 1 GiB afterwards\n* `:c,vmaxn=4k` block uploads if volume would contain more than 4096 files afterwards\n* `:c,nosub` disallow uploading into subdirectories; goes well with `rotn` and `rotf`:\n* `:c,rotn=1000,2` moves uploads into subfolders, up to 1000 files in each folder before making a new one, two levels deep (must be at least 1)\n* `:c,rotf=%Y/%m/%d/%H` enforces files to be uploaded into a structure of subfolders according to that date format\n  * if someone uploads to `/foo/bar` the path would be rewritten to `/foo/bar/2021/08/06/23` for example\n  * but the actual value is not verified, just the structure, so the uploader can choose any values which conform to the format string\n    * just to avoid additional complexity in up2k which is enough of a mess already\n* `:c,lifetime=300` delete uploaded files when they become 5 minutes old\n\nyou can also set transaction limits which apply per-IP and per-volume, but these assume `-j 1` (default) otherwise the limits will be off, for example `-j 4` would allow anywhere between 1x and 4x the limits you set depending on which processing node the client gets routed to\n\n* `:c,maxn=250,3600` allows 250 files over 1 hour from each IP (tracked per-volume)\n* `:c,maxb=1g,300` allows 1 GiB total over 5 minutes from each IP (tracked per-volume)\n\nnotes:\n* `vmaxb` and `vmaxn` requires either the `e2ds` volflag or `-e2dsa` global-option\n\n\n## compress uploads\n\nfiles can be autocompressed on upload,  either on user-request (if config allows) or forced by server-config\n\n* volflag `gz` allows gz compression\n* volflag `xz` allows lzma compression\n* volflag `pk` **forces** compression on all files\n* url parameter `pk` requests compression with server-default algorithm\n* url parameter `gz` or `xz` requests compression with a specific algorithm\n* url parameter `xz` requests xz compression\n\nthings to note,\n* the `gz` and `xz` arguments take a single optional argument, the compression level (range 0 to 9)\n* the `pk` volflag takes the optional argument `ALGORITHM,LEVEL` which will then be forced for all uploads, for example `gz,9` or `xz,0`\n* default compression is gzip level 9\n* all upload methods except up2k are supported\n* the files will be indexed after compression, so dupe-detection and file-search will not work as expected\n\nsome examples,\n* `-v inc:inc:w:c,pk=xz,0`  \n  folder named inc, shared at inc, write-only for everyone, forces xz compression at level 0\n* `-v inc:inc:w:c,pk`  \n  same write-only inc, but forces gz compression (default) instead of xz\n* `-v inc:inc:w:c,gz`  \n  allows (but does not force) gz compression if client uploads to `/inc?pk` or `/inc?gz` or `/inc?gz=4`\n\n\n## other flags\n\n* `:c,magic` enables filetype detection for nameless uploads, same as `--magic`\n  * needs https://pypi.org/project/python-magic/ `python3 -m pip install --user -U python-magic`\n  * on windows grab this instead `python3 -m pip install --user -U python-magic-bin`\n\n\n## database location\n\nin-volume (`.hist/up2k.db`, default) or somewhere else\n\ncopyparty creates a subfolder named `.hist` inside each volume where it stores the database, thumbnails, and some other stuff\n\nthis can instead be kept in a single place using the `--hist` argument, or the `hist=` volflag, or a mix of both:\n* `--hist ~/.cache/copyparty -v ~/music::r:c,hist=-` sets `~/.cache/copyparty` as the default place to put volume info, but `~/music` gets the regular `.hist` subfolder (`-` restores default behavior)\n\nnote:\n* markdown edits are always stored in a local `.hist` subdirectory\n* on windows the volflag path is cyglike, so `/c/temp` means `C:\\temp` but use regular paths for `--hist`\n  * you can use cygpaths for volumes too, `-v C:\\Users::r` and `-v /c/users::r` both work\n\n\n## metadata from audio files\n\nset `-e2t` to index tags on upload\n\n`-mte` decides which tags to index and display in the browser (and also the display order), this can be changed per-volume:\n* `-v ~/music::r:c,mte=title,artist` indexes and displays *title* followed by *artist*\n\nif you add/remove a tag from `mte` you will need to run with `-e2tsr` once to rebuild the database, otherwise only new files will be affected\n\nbut instead of using `-mte`, `-mth` is a better way to hide tags in the browser: these tags will not be displayed by default, but they still get indexed and become searchable, and users can choose to unhide them in the `[⚙️] config` pane\n\n`-mtm` can be used to add or redefine a metadata mapping, say you have media files with `foo` and `bar` tags and you want them to display as `qux` in the browser (preferring `foo` if both are present), then do `-mtm qux=foo,bar` and now you can `-mte artist,title,qux`\n\ntags that start with a `.` such as `.bpm` and `.dur`(ation) indicate numeric value\n\nsee the beautiful mess of a dictionary in [mtag.py](https://github.com/9001/copyparty/blob/hovudstraum/copyparty/mtag.py) for the default mappings (should cover mp3,opus,flac,m4a,wav,aif,)\n\n`--no-mutagen` disables Mutagen and uses FFprobe instead, which...\n* is about 20x slower than Mutagen\n* catches a few tags that Mutagen doesn't\n  * melodic key, video resolution, framerate, pixfmt\n* avoids pulling any GPL code into copyparty\n* more importantly runs FFprobe on incoming files which is bad if your FFmpeg has a cve\n\n`--mtag-to` sets the tag-scan timeout; very high default (60 sec) to cater for zfs and other randomly-freezing filesystems. Lower values like 10 are usually safe, allowing for faster processing of tricky files\n\n\n## file parser plugins\n\nprovide custom parsers to index additional tags,  also see [./bin/mtag/README.md](./bin/mtag/README.md)\n\ncopyparty can invoke external programs to collect additional metadata for files using `mtp` (either as argument or volflag), there is a default timeout of 60sec, and only files which contain audio get analyzed by default (see ay/an/ad below)\n\n* `-mtp .bpm=~/bin/audio-bpm.py` will execute `~/bin/audio-bpm.py` with the audio file as argument 1 to provide the `.bpm` tag, if that does not exist in the audio metadata\n* `-mtp key=f,t5,~/bin/audio-key.py` uses `~/bin/audio-key.py` to get the `key` tag, replacing any existing metadata tag (`f,`), aborting if it takes longer than 5sec (`t5,`)\n* `-v ~/music::r:c,mtp=.bpm=~/bin/audio-bpm.py:c,mtp=key=f,t5,~/bin/audio-key.py` both as a per-volume config wow this is getting ugly\n\n*but wait, there's more!* `-mtp` can be used for non-audio files as well using the `a` flag: `ay` only do audio files (default), `an` only do non-audio files, or `ad` do all files (d as in dontcare)\n\n* \"audio file\" also means videos btw, as long as there is an audio stream\n* `-mtp ext=an,~/bin/file-ext.py` runs `~/bin/file-ext.py` to get the `ext` tag only if file is not audio (`an`)\n* `-mtp arch,built,ver,orig=an,eexe,edll,~/bin/exe.py` runs `~/bin/exe.py` to get properties about windows-binaries only if file is not audio (`an`) and file extension is exe or dll\n* if you want to daisychain parsers, use the `p` flag to set processing order\n  * `-mtp foo=p1,~/a.py` runs before `-mtp foo=p2,~/b.py` and will forward all the tags detected so far as json to the stdin of b.py\n* option `c0` disables capturing of stdout/stderr, so copyparty will not receive any tags from the process at all -- instead the invoked program is free to print whatever to the console, just using copyparty as a launcher\n  * `c1` captures stdout only, `c2` only stderr, and `c3` (default) captures both\n* you can control how the parser is killed if it times out with option `kt` killing the entire process tree (default), `km` just the main process, or `kn` let it continue running until copyparty is terminated\n\nif something doesn't work, try `--mtag-v` for verbose error messages\n\n\n## event hooks\n\ntrigger a program on uploads, renames etc ([examples](./bin/hooks/))\n\nyou can set hooks before and/or after an event happens, and currently you can hook uploads, moves/renames, and deletes\n\nthere's a bunch of flags and stuff, see `--help-hooks`\n\nif you want to write your own hooks, see [devnotes](./docs/devnotes.md#event-hooks)\n\n\n### upload events\n\nthe older, more powerful approach ([examples](./bin/mtag/)):\n\n```\n-v /mnt/inc:inc:w:c,mte=+x1:c,mtp=x1=ad,kn,/usr/bin/notify-send\n```\n\nso filesystem location `/mnt/inc` shared at `/inc`, write-only for everyone, appending `x1` to the list of tags to index (`mte`), and using `/usr/bin/notify-send` to \"provide\" tag `x1` for any filetype (`ad`) with kill-on-timeout disabled (`kn`)\n\nthat'll run the command `notify-send` with the path to the uploaded file as the first and only argument (so on linux it'll show a notification on-screen)\n\nnote that this is way more complicated than the new [event hooks](#event-hooks) but this approach has the following advantages:\n* non-blocking and multithreaded; doesn't hold other uploads back\n* you get access to tags from FFmpeg and other mtp parsers\n* only trigger on new unique files, not dupes\n\nnote that it will occupy the parsing threads, so fork anything expensive (or set `kn` to have copyparty fork it for you) -- otoh if you want to intentionally queue/singlethread you can combine it with `--mtag-mt 1`\n\n\n## handlers\n\nredefine behavior with plugins ([examples](./bin/handlers/))\n\nreplace 404 and 403 errors with something completely different (that's it for now)\n\n\n## ip auth\n\nautologin based on IP range (CIDR)  , using the global-option `--ipu`\n\nfor example, if everyone with an IP that starts with `192.168.123` should automatically log in as the user `spartacus`, then you can either specify `--ipu=192.168.123.0/24=spartacus` as a commandline option, or put this in a config file:\n\n```yaml\n[global]\n  ipu: 192.168.123.0/24=spartacus\n```\n\nrepeat the option to map additional subnets\n\n**be careful with this one!** if you have a reverseproxy, then you definitely want to make sure you have [real-ip](#real-ip) configured correctly, and it's probably a good idea to nullmap the reverseproxy's IP just in case; so if your reverseproxy is sending requests from `172.24.27.9` then that would be `--ipu=172.24.27.9/32=`\n\n\n## identity providers\n\nreplace copyparty passwords with oauth and such\n\nyou can disable the built-in password-based login system, and instead replace it with a separate piece of software (an identity provider) which will then handle authenticating / authorizing of users; this makes it possible to login with passkeys / fido2 / webauthn / yubikey / ldap / active directory / oauth / many other single-sign-on contraptions\n\na popular choice is [Authelia](https://www.authelia.com/) (config-file based), another one is [authentik](https://goauthentik.io/) (GUI-based, more complex)\n\nthere is a [docker-compose example](./docs/examples/docker/idp-authelia-traefik) which is hopefully a good starting point (alternatively see [./docs/idp.md](./docs/idp.md) if you're the DIY type)\n\na more complete example of the copyparty configuration options [look like this](./docs/examples/docker/idp/copyparty.conf)\n\nbut if you just want to let users change their own passwords, then you probably want [user-changeable passwords](#user-changeable-passwords) instead\n\n\n## user-changeable passwords\n\nif permitted, users can change their own passwords  in the control-panel\n\n* not compatible with [identity providers](#identity-providers)\n\n* must be enabled with `--chpw` because account-sharing is a popular usecase\n\n  * if you want to enable the feature but deny password-changing for a specific list of accounts, you can do that with `--chpw-no name1,name2,name3,...`\n\n* to perform a password reset, edit the server config and give the user another password there, then do a [config reload](#server-config) or server restart\n\n* the custom passwords are kept in a textfile at filesystem-path `--chpw-db`, by default `chpw.json` in the copyparty config folder\n\n  * if you run multiple copyparty instances with different users you *almost definitely* want to specify separate DBs for each instance\n\n  * if [password hashing](#password-hashing) is enabled, the passwords in the db are also hashed\n\n    * ...which means that all user-defined passwords will be forgotten if you change password-hashing settings\n\n\n## using the cloud as storage\n\nconnecting to an aws s3 bucket and similar\n\nthere is no built-in support for this, but you can use FUSE-software such as [rclone](https://rclone.org/) / [geesefs](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/geesefs) / [JuiceFS](https://juicefs.com/en/) to first mount your cloud storage as a local disk, and then let copyparty use (a folder in) that disk as a volume\n\nyou may experience poor upload performance this way, but that can sometimes be fixed by specifying the volflag `sparse` to force the use of sparse files; this has improved the upload speeds from `1.5 MiB/s` to over `80 MiB/s` in one case, but note that you are also more likely to discover funny bugs in your FUSE software this way, so buckle up\n\nsomeone has also tested geesefs in combination with [gocryptfs](https://nuetzlich.net/gocryptfs/) with surprisingly good results, getting 60 MiB/s upload speeds on a gbit line, but JuiceFS won with 80 MiB/s using its built-in encryption\n\nyou may improve performance by specifying larger values for `--iobuf` / `--s-rd-sz` / `--s-wr-sz`\n\n\n## hiding from google\n\ntell search engines you don't wanna be indexed,  either using the good old [robots.txt](https://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html) or through copyparty settings:\n\n* `--no-robots` adds HTTP (`X-Robots-Tag`) and HTML (`<meta>`) headers with `noindex, nofollow` globally\n* volflag `[...]:c,norobots` does the same thing for that single volume\n* volflag `[...]:c,robots` ALLOWS search-engine crawling for that volume, even if `--no-robots` is set

is `html.a`, second theme (2 and 3) is `html.b`\n* if a light theme is selected, `html.y` is set, otherwise `html.z` is\n* so if the dark edition of the 2nd theme is selected, you use any of `html.b`,

port\n\n**if you're on windows,** then you just need to add the commandline argument `-p 80,443` and you're done! nice\n\n**if you're on macos,** sorry, I don't know\n\n**if you're on Linux,** you have the following 4 options:\n\n* **option 1:** set up a [reverse-proxy](#reverse-proxy) -- this one makes a lot of sense if you're running on a proper headless server, because that way you get real HTTPS too\n\n* **option 2:** NAT to port 3923 -- this is cumbersome since you'll need to do it every time you reboot, and the exact command may depend on your linux distribution:\n  ```bash\n  iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 3923\n  iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-port 3923\n  ```\n\n* **option 3:** disable the [security policy](https://www.w3.org/Daemon/User/Installation/PrivilegedPorts.html) which prevents the use of 80 and 443; this is *probably* fine:\n  ```\n  setcap CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE=+eip $(realpath $(which python))\n  python copyparty-sfx.py -p 80,443\n  ```\n\n* **option 4:** run copyparty as root (please don't)\n\n\n## reverse-proxy\n\nrunning copyparty next to other websites  hosted on an existing webserver such as nginx, caddy, or apache\n\nyou can either:\n* give copyparty its own domain or subdomain (recommended)\n* or do location-based proxying, using `--rp-loc=/stuff` to tell copyparty where it is mounted -- has a slight performance cost and higher chance of bugs\n  * if copyparty says `incorrect --rp-loc or webserver config; expected vpath starting with [...]` it's likely because the webserver is stripping away the proxy location from the request URLs -- see the `ProxyPass` in the apache example below\n\nwhen running behind a reverse-proxy (this includes services like cloudflare), it is important to configure real-ip correctly, as many features rely on knowing the client's IP. Look out for red and yellow log messages which explain how to do this. But basically, set `--xff-hdr` to the name of the http header to read the IP from (usually `x-forwarded-for`, but cloudflare uses `cf-connecting-ip`), and then `--xff-src` to the IP of the reverse-proxy so copyparty will trust the xff-hdr. Note that `--rp-loc` in particular will not work at all unless you do this\n\nsome reverse proxies (such as [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/)) can automatically obtain a valid https/tls certificate for you, and some support HTTP/2 and QUIC which *could* be a nice speed boost, depending on a lot of factors\n* **warning:** nginx-QUIC (HTTP/3) is still experimental and can make uploads much slower, so HTTP/1.1 is recommended for now\n* depending on server/client, HTTP/1.1 can also be 5x faster than HTTP/2\n\nfor improved security (and a 10% performance boost) consider listening on a unix-socket with `-i unix:770:www:/tmp/party.sock` (permission `770` means only members of group `www` can access it)\n\nexample webserver configs:\n\n* [nginx config](contrib/nginx/copyparty.conf) -- entire domain/subdomain\n* [apache2 config](contrib/apache/copyparty.conf) -- location-based\n\n\n### real-ip\n\nteaching copyparty how to see client IPs  when running behind a reverse-proxy, or a WAF, or another protection service such as cloudflare\n\nif you (and maybe everybody else) keep getting a message that says `thank you for playing`, then you've gotten banned for malicious traffic. This ban applies to the IP address that copyparty *thinks* identifies the shady client -- so, depending on your setup, you might have to tell copyparty where to find the correct IP\n\nfor most common setups, there should be a helpful message in the server-log explaining what to do, but see [docs/xff.md](docs/xff.md) if you want to learn more, including a quick hack to **just make it work** (which is **not** recommended, but hey...)\n\n\n## prometheus\n\nmetrics/stats can be enabled  at URL `/.cpr/metrics` for grafana / prometheus / etc (openmetrics 1.0.0)\n\nmust be enabled with `--stats` since it reduces startup time a tiny bit, and you probably want `-e2dsa` too\n\nthe endpoint is only accessible by `admin` accounts, meaning the `a` in `rwmda` in the following example commandline: `python3 -m copyparty -a ed:wark -v /mnt/nas::rwmda,ed --stats -e2dsa`\n\nfollow a guide for setting up `node_exporter` except have it read from copyparty instead; example `/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml` below\n\n```yaml\nscrape_configs:\n  - job_name: copyparty\n    metrics_path: /.cpr/metrics\n    basic_auth:\n      password: wark\n    static_configs:\n      - targets: ['192.168.123.1:3923']\n```\n\ncurrently the following metrics are available,\n* `cpp_uptime_seconds` time since last copyparty restart\n* `cpp_boot_unixtime_seconds` same but as an absolute timestamp\n* `cpp_http_conns` number of open http(s) connections\n* `cpp_http_reqs` number of http(s) requests handled\n* `cpp_sus_reqs` number of 403/422/malicious requests\n* `cpp_active_bans` number of currently banned IPs\n* `cpp_total_bans` number of IPs banned since last restart\n\nthese are available unless `--nos-vst` is specified:\n* `cpp_db_idle_seconds` time since last database activity (upload/rename/delete)\n* `cpp_db_act_seconds` same but as an absolute timestamp\n* `cpp_idle_vols` number of volumes which are idle / ready\n* `cpp_busy_vols` number of volumes which are busy / indexing\n* `cpp_offline_vols` number of volumes which are offline / unavailable\n* `cpp_hashing_files` number of files queued for hashing / indexing\n* `cpp_tagq_files` number of files queued for metadata scanning\n* `cpp_mtpq_files` number of files queued for plugin-based analysis\n\nand these are available per-volume only:\n* `cpp_disk_size_bytes` total HDD size\n* `cpp_disk_free_bytes` free HDD space\n\nand these are per-volume and `total`:\n* `cpp_vol_bytes` size of all files in volume\n* `cpp_vol_files` number of files\n* `cpp_dupe_bytes` disk space presumably saved by deduplication\n* `cpp_dupe_files` number of dupe files\n* `cpp_unf_bytes` currently unfinished / incoming uploads\n\nsome of the metrics have additional requirements to function correctly,\n* `cpp_vol_*` requires either the `e2ds` volflag or `-e2dsa` global-option\n\nthe following options are available to disable some of the metrics:\n* `--nos-hdd` disables `cpp_disk_*` which can prevent spinning up HDDs\n* `--nos-vol` disables `cpp_vol_*` which reduces server startup time\n* `--nos-vst` disables volume state, reducing the worst-case prometheus query time by 0.5 sec\n* `--nos-dup` disables `cpp_dupe_*` which reduces the server load caused by prometheus queries\n* `--nos-unf` disables `cpp_unf_*` for no particular purpose\n\nnote: the following metrics are counted incorrectly if multiprocessing is enabled with `-j`: `cpp_http_conns`, `cpp_http_reqs`, `cpp_sus_reqs`, `cpp_active_bans`, `cpp_total_bans`\n\n\n## other extremely specific features\n\nyou'll never find a use for these:\n\n\n### custom mimetypes\n\nchange the association of a file extension\n\nusing commandline args, you can do something like `--mime gif=image/jif` and `--mime ts=text/x.typescript` (can be specified multiple times)\n\nin a config-file, this is the same as:\n\n```yaml\n[global]\n  mime: gif=image/jif\n  mime: ts=text/x.typescript\n```\n\nrun copyparty with `--mimes` to list all the default mappings\n\n\n### feature chickenbits\n\nbuggy feature? rip it out  by setting any of the following environment variables to disable its associated bell or whistle,\n\n| env-var              | what it does |\n| -------------------- | ------------ |\n| `PRTY_NO_IFADDR`     | disable ip/nic discovery by poking into your OS with ctypes |\n| `PRTY_NO_IPV6`       | disable some ipv6 support (should not be necessary since windows 2000) |\n| `PRTY_NO_LZMA`       | disable streaming xz compression of incoming uploads |\n| `PRTY_NO_MP`         | disable all use of the python `multiprocessing` module (actual multithreading, cpu-count for parsers/thumbnailers) |\n| `PRTY_NO_SQLITE`     | disable all database-related functionality (file indexing, metadata indexing, most file deduplication logic) |\n| `PRTY_NO_TLS`        | disable native HTTPS support; if you still want to accept HTTPS connections then TLS must now be terminated by a reverse-proxy |\n| `PRTY_NO_TPOKE`      | disable systemd-tmpfilesd avoider |\n\nexample: `PRTY_NO_IFADDR=1 python3 copyparty-sfx.py`\n\n\n# packages\n\nthe party might be closer than you think\n\nif your distro/OS is not mentioned below, there might be some hints in the [«on servers»](#on-servers) section\n\n\n## arch package\n\nnow [available on aur](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/copyparty) maintained by [@icxes](https://github.com/icxes)\n\nit comes with a [systemd service](./contrib/package/arch/copyparty.service) and expects to find one or more [config files](./docs/example.conf) in `/etc/copyparty.d/`\n\n\n## fedora package\n\ndoes not exist yet;  using the [copr-pypi](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/g/copr/PyPI/) builds is **NOT recommended** because updates can be delayed by [several months](https://github.com/fedora-copr/copr/issues/3056)\n\n\n## nix package\n\n`nix profile install github:9001/copyparty`\n\nrequires a [flake-enabled](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) installation of nix\n\nsome recommended dependencies are enabled by default; [override the package](https://github.com/9001/copyparty/blob/hovudstraum/contrib/package/nix/copyparty/default.nix#L3-L22) if you want to add/remove some features/deps\n\n`ffmpeg-full` was chosen over `ffmpeg-headless` mainly because we need `withWebp` (and `withOpenmpt` is also nice) and being able to use a cached build felt more important than optimizing for size at the time -- PRs welcome if you disagree 👍\n\n\n## nixos module\n\nfor this setup, you will need a [flake-enabled](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) installation of NixOS.\n\n```nix\n{\n  # add copyparty flake to your inputs\n  inputs.copyparty.url = \"github:9001/copyparty\";\n\n  # ensure that copyparty is an allowed argument to the outputs function\n  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, copyparty }: {\n    nixosConfigurations.yourHostName = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {\n      modules = [\n        # load the copyparty NixOS module\n        copyparty.nixosModules.default\n        ({ pkgs, ... }: {\n          # add the copyparty overlay to expose the package to the module\n          nixpkgs.overlays = [ copyparty.overlays.default ];\n          # (optional) install the package globally\n          environment.systemPackages = [ pkgs.copyparty ];\n          # configure the copyparty module\n          services.copyparty.enable = true;\n        })\n      ];\n    };\n  };\n}\n```\n\ncopyparty on NixOS is configured via `services.copyparty` options, for example:\n```nix\nservices.copyparty = {\n  enable = true;\n  # directly maps to values in the [global] section of the copyparty config.\n  # see `copyparty --help` for available options\n  settings = {\n    i = \"0.0.0.0\";\n    # use lists to set multiple values\n    p = [ 3210 3211 ];\n    # use booleans to set binary flags\n    no-reload = true;\n    # using 'false' will do nothing and omit the value when generating a config\n    ignored-flag = false;\n  };\n\n  # create users\n  accounts = {\n    # specify the account name as the key\n    ed = {\n      # provide the path to a file containing the password, keeping it out of /nix/store\n      # must be readable by the copyparty service user\n      passwordFile = \"/run/keys/copyparty/ed_password\";\n    };\n    # or do both in one go\n    k.passwordFile = \"/run/keys/copyparty/k_password\";\n  };\n\n  # create a volume\n  volumes = {\n    # create a volume at \"/\" (the webroot), which will\n    \"/\" = {\n      # share the contents of \"/srv/copyparty\"\n      path = \"/srv/copyparty\";\n      # see `copyparty --help-accounts` for available options\n      access = {\n        # everyone gets read-access, but\n        r = \"*\";\n        # users \"ed\" and \"k\" get read-write\n        rw = [ \"ed\" \"k\" ];\n      };\n      # see `copyparty --help-flags` for available options\n      flags = {\n        # \"fk\" enables filekeys (necessary for upget permission) (4 chars long)\n        fk = 4;\n        # scan for new files every 60sec\n        scan = 60;\n        # volflag \"e2d\" enables the uploads database\n        e2d = true;\n        # \"d2t\" disables multimedia parsers (in case the uploads are malicious)\n        d2t = true;\n        # skips hashing file contents if path matches *.iso\n        nohash = \"\\.iso$\";\n      };\n    };\n  };\n  # you may increase the open file limit for the process\n  openFilesLimit = 8192;\n};\n```\n\nthe passwordFile at /run/keys/copyparty/ could for example be generated by [agenix](https://github.com/ryantm/agenix), or you could just dump it in the nix store instead if that's acceptable\n\n\n# browser support\n\nTLDR: yes\n\n![copyparty-ie4-fs8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/241032/118192791-fb31fe00-b446-11eb-9647-898ea8efc1f7.png)\n\n`ie` = internet-explorer,

Also, make sure to always leave a trailing slash in URLs unless you want to override the filename\n\n\n## folder sync\n\nsync folders to/from copyparty\n\nthe commandline uploader [u2c.py](https://github.com/9001/copyparty/tree/hovudstraum/bin#u2cpy) with `--dr` is the best way to sync a folder to copyparty; verifies checksums and does files in parallel, and deletes unexpected files on the server after upload has finished which makes file-renames really cheap (it'll rename serverside and skip uploading)\n\nalternatively there is [rclone](./docs/rclone.md) which allows for bidirectional sync and is *way* more flexible (stream files straight from sftp/s3/gcs to copyparty, ...), although there is no integrity check and it won't work with files over 100 MiB if copyparty is behind cloudflare\n\n* starting from rclone v1.63, rclone is faster than u2c.py on low-latency connections\n\n\n## mount as drive\n\na remote copyparty server as a local filesystem;  go to the control-panel and click `connect` to see a list of commands to do that\n\nalternatively, some alternatives roughly sorted by speed (unreproducible benchmark), best first:\n\n* [rclone-webdav](./docs/rclone.md) (25s), read/WRITE (rclone v1.63 or later)\n* [rclone-http](./docs/rclone.md) (26s), read-only\n* [partyfuse.py](./bin/#partyfusepy) (26s), read-only\n* [rclone-ftp](./docs/rclone.md) (47s), read/WRITE\n* davfs2 (103s), read/WRITE\n* [win10-webdav](#webdav-server) (138s), read/WRITE\n* [win10-smb2](#smb-server) (387s), read/WRITE\n\nmost clients will fail to mount the root of a copyparty server unless there is a root volume (so you get the admin-panel instead of a browser when accessing it) -- in that case, mount a specific volume instead\n\nif you have volumes that are accessible without a password, then some webdav clients (such as davfs2) require the global-option `--dav-auth` to access any password-protected areas\n\n\n# android app\n\nupload to copyparty with one tap\n\n<a href=\"https://f-droid.org/packages/me.ocv.partyup/\"><img src=\"https://ocv.me/fdroid.png\" alt=\"Get it on F-Droid\" height=\"50\" /> '' <img src=\"https://img.shields.io/f-droid/v/me.ocv.partyup.svg\" alt=\"f-droid version info\" /></a> '' <a href=\"https://github.com/9001/party-up\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/github/release/9001/party-up.svg?logo=github\" alt=\"github version info\" /></a>\n\nthe app is **NOT** the full copyparty server! just a basic upload client, nothing fancy yet\n\nif you want to run the copyparty server on your android device, see [install on android](#install-on-android)\n\n\n# iOS shortcuts\n\nthere is no iPhone app, but  the following shortcuts are almost as good:\n\n* [upload to copyparty](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/41e98dd985cb4d3bb433222bc1e9e770) ([offline](https://github.com/9001/copyparty/raw/hovudstraum/contrib/ios/upload-to-copyparty.shortcut)) ([png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/241032/226118053-78623554-b0ed-482e-98e4-6d57ada58ea4.png)) based on the [original](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/ab415d5b4de3467b9ce6f151b439a5d7) by [Daedren](https://github.com/Daedren) (thx!)\n  * can strip exif, upload files, pics, vids, links, clipboard\n  * can download links and rehost the target file on copyparty (see first comment inside the shortcut)\n  * pics become lowres if you share from gallery to shortcut, so better to launch the shortcut and pick stuff from there\n\n\n# performance\n\ndefaults are usually fine - expect `8 GiB/s` download, `1 GiB/s` upload\n\nbelow are some tweaks roughly ordered by usefulness:\n\n* disabling HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 can make uploads 5x faster, depending on server/client software\n* `-q` disables logging and can help a bunch, even when combined with `-lo` to redirect logs to file\n* `--hist` pointing to a fast location (ssd) will make directory listings and searches faster when `-e2d` or `-e2t` is set\n  * and also makes thumbnails load faster, regardless of e2d/e2t\n* `--dedup` enables deduplication and thus avoids writing to the HDD if someone uploads a dupe\n* `--safe-dedup 1` makes deduplication much faster during upload by skipping verification of file contents; safe if there is no other software editing/moving the files in the volumes\n* `--no-dirsz` shows the size of folder inodes instead of the total size of the contents, giving about 30% faster folder listings\n* `--no-hash .` when indexing a network-disk if you don't care about the actual filehashes and only want the names/tags searchable\n* if your volumes are on a network-disk such as NFS / SMB / s3, specifying larger values for `--iobuf` and/or `--s-rd-sz` and/or `--s-wr-sz` may help; try setting all of them to `524288` or `1048576` or `4194304`\n* `--no-htp --hash-mt=0 --mtag-mt=1 --th-mt=1` minimizes the number of threads; can help in some eccentric environments (like the vscode debugger)\n* `-j0` enables multiprocessing (actual multithreading), can reduce latency to `20+80/numCores` percent and generally improve performance in cpu-intensive workloads, for example:\n  * lots of connections (many users or heavy clients)\n  * simultaneous downloads and uploads saturating a 20gbps connection\n  * if `-e2d` is enabled, `-j2` gives 4x performance for directory listings; `-j4` gives 16x\n  \n  ...however it also increases the server/filesystem/HDD load during uploads, and adds an overhead to internal communication, so it is usually a better idea to don't\n* using [pypy](https://www.pypy.org/) instead of [cpython](https://www.python.org/) *can* be 70% faster for some workloads, but slower for many others\n  * and pypy can sometimes crash on startup with `-j0` (TODO make issue)\n\n\n## client-side\n\nwhen uploading files,\n\n* chrome is recommended (unfortunately), at least compared to firefox:\n  * up to 90% faster when hashing, especially on SSDs\n  * up to 40% faster when uploading over extremely fast internets\n  * but [u2c.py](https://github.com/9001/copyparty/blob/hovudstraum/bin/u2c.py) can be 40% faster than chrome again\n\n* if you're cpu-bottlenecked, or the browser is maxing a cpu core:\n  * up to 30% faster uploads if you hide the upload status list by switching away from the `[🚀]` up2k ui-tab (or closing it)\n    * optionally you can switch to the lightweight potato ui by clicking the `[🥔]`\n    * switching to another browser-tab also works, the favicon will update every 10 seconds in that case\n  * unlikely to be a problem, but can happen when uploading many small files, or your internet is too fast, or PC too slow\n\n\n# security\n\nthere is a [discord server](https://discord.gg/25J8CdTT6G)  with an `@everyone` for all important updates (at the lack of better ideas)\n\nsome notes on hardening\n\n* set `--rproxy 0` if your copyparty is directly facing the internet (not through a reverse-proxy)\n  * cors doesn't work right otherwise\n* if you allow anonymous uploads or otherwise don't trust the contents of a volume, you can prevent XSS with volflag `nohtml`\n  * this returns html documents as plaintext, and also disables markdown rendering\n* when running behind a reverse-proxy, listen on a unix-socket for tighter access control (and more performance); see [reverse-proxy](#reverse-proxy) or `--help-bind`\n\nsafety profiles:\n\n* option `-s` is a shortcut to set the following options:\n  * `--no-thumb` disables thumbnails and audio transcoding to stop copyparty from running `FFmpeg`/`Pillow`/`VIPS` on uploaded files, which is a [good idea](https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list.php?vendor_id=3611) if anonymous upload is enabled\n  * `--no-mtag-ff` uses `mutagen` to grab music tags instead of `FFmpeg`, which is safer and faster but less accurate\n  * `--dotpart` hides uploads from directory listings while they're still incoming\n  * `--no-robots` and `--force-js` makes life harder for crawlers, see [hiding from google](#hiding-from-google)\n\n* option `-ss` is a shortcut for the above plus:\n  * `--unpost 0`, `--no-del`, `--no-mv` disables all move/delete support\n  * `--hardlink` creates hardlinks instead of symlinks when deduplicating uploads, which is less maintenance\n    * however note if you edit one file it will also affect the other copies\n  * `--vague-403` returns a \"404 not found\" instead of \"401 unauthorized\" which is a common enterprise meme\n  * `-nih` removes the server hostname from directory listings\n\n* option `-sss` is a shortcut for the above plus:\n  * `--no-dav` disables webdav support\n  * `--no-logues` and `--no-readme` disables support for readme's and prologues / epilogues in directory listings, which otherwise lets people upload arbitrary (but sandboxed) `<script>` tags\n  * `-lo cpp-%Y-%m%d-%H%M%S.txt.xz` enables logging to disk\n  * `-ls **,*,ln,p,r` does a scan on startup for any dangerous symlinks\n\nother misc notes:\n\n* you can disable directory listings by giving permission `g` instead of `r`, only accepting direct URLs to files\n  * you may want [filekeys](#filekeys) to prevent filename bruteforcing\n  * permission `h` instead of `r` makes copyparty behave like a traditional webserver with directory listing/index disabled, returning index.html instead\n    * compatibility with filekeys: index.html itself can be retrieved without the correct filekey, but all other files are protected\n\n\n## gotchas\n\nbehavior that might be unexpected\n\n* users without read-access to a folder can still see the `.prologue.html` / `.epilogue.html` / `PREADME.md` / `README.md` contents, for the purpose of showing a description on how to use the uploader for example\n* users can submit `<script>`s which autorun (in a sandbox) for other visitors in a few ways;\n  * uploading a `README.md` -- avoid with `--no-readme`\n  * renaming `some.html` to `.epilogue.html` -- avoid with either `--no-logues` or `--no-dot-ren`\n  * the directory-listing embed is sandboxed (so any malicious scripts can't do any damage) but the markdown editor is not 100% safe, see below\n* markdown documents can contain html and `<script>`s; attempts are made to prevent scripts from executing (unless `-emp` is specified) but this is not 100% bulletproof, so setting the `nohtml` volflag is still the safest choice\n  * or eliminate the problem entirely by only giving write-access to trustworthy people :^)\n\n\n## cors\n\ncross-site request config\n\nby default, except for `GET` and `HEAD` operations, all requests must either:\n* not contain an `Origin` header at all\n* or have an `Origin` matching the server domain\n* or the header `PW` with your password as value\n\ncors can be configured with `--acao` and `--acam`, or the protections entirely disabled with `--allow-csrf`\n\n\n## filekeys\n\nprevent filename bruteforcing\n\nvolflag `fk` generates filekeys (per-file accesskeys) for all files; users which have full read-access (permission `r`) will then see URLs with the correct filekey `?k=...` appended to the end, and `g` users must provide that URL including the correct key to avoid a 404\n\nby default, filekeys are generated based on salt (`--fk-salt`) + filesystem-path + file-size + inode (if not windows); add volflag `fka` to generate slightly weaker filekeys which will not be invalidated if the file is edited (only salt + path)\n\npermissions `wG` (write + upget) lets users upload files and receive their own filekeys, still without being able to see other uploads\n\n### dirkeys\n\nshare specific folders in a volume  without giving away full read-access to the rest -- the visitor only needs the `g` (get) permission to view the link\n\nvolflag `dk` generates dirkeys (per-directory accesskeys) for all folders, granting read-access to that folder; by default only that folder itself, no subfolders\n\nvolflag `dky` disables the actual key-check, meaning anyone can see the contents of a folder where they have `g` access, but not its subdirectories\n\n* `dk` + `dky` gives the same behavior as if all users with `g` access have full read-access, but subfolders are hidden files (as if their names start with a dot), so `dky` is an alternative to renaming all the folders for that purpose, maybe just for some users\n\nvolflag `dks` lets people enter subfolders as well, and also enables download-as-zip/tar\n\nif you enable dirkeys, it is probably a good idea to enable filekeys too, otherwise it will be impossible to hotlink files from a folder which was accessed using a dirkey\n\ndirkeys are generated based on another salt (`--dk-salt`) + filesystem-path and have a few limitations:\n* the key does not change if the contents of the folder is modified\n  * if you need a new dirkey, either change the salt or rename the folder\n* linking to a textfile (so it opens in the textfile viewer) is not possible if recipient doesn't have read-access\n\n\n## password hashing\n\nyou can hash passwords  before putting them into config files / providing them as arguments; see `--help-pwhash` for all the details\n\n`--ah-alg argon2` enables it, and if you have any plaintext passwords then it'll print the hashed versions on startup so you can replace them\n\noptionally also specify `--ah-cli` to enter an interactive mode where it will hash passwords without ever writing the plaintext ones to disk\n\nthe default configs take about 0.4 sec and 256 MiB RAM to process a new password on a decent laptop\n\n\n## https\n\nboth HTTP and HTTPS are accepted  by default, but letting a [reverse proxy](#reverse-proxy) handle the https/tls/ssl would be better (probably more secure by default)\n\ncopyparty doesn't speak HTTP/2 or QUIC, so using a reverse proxy would solve that as well -- but note that HTTP/1 is usually faster than both HTTP/2 and HTTP/3\n\nif [cfssl](https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl/releases/latest) is installed, copyparty will automatically create a CA and server-cert on startup\n* the certs are written to `--crt-dir` for distribution, see `--help` for the other `--crt` options\n* this will be a self-signed certificate so you must install your `ca.pem` into all your browsers/devices\n* if you want to avoid the hassle of distributing certs manually, please consider using a reverse proxy\n\n\n# recovering from crashes\n\n## client crashes\n\n### firefox wsod\n\nfirefox 87 can crash during uploads  -- the entire browser goes, including all other browser tabs, everything turns white\n\nhowever you can hit `F12` in the up2k tab and use the devtools to see how far you got in the uploads:\n\n* get a complete list of all uploads, organized by status (ok / no-good / busy / queued):  \n  `var tabs = { ok:[], ng:[], bz:[], q:[] }; for (var a of up2k.ui.tab) tabs[a.in].push(a); tabs`\n\n* list of filenames which failed:  \n  `​var ng = []; for (var a of up2k.ui.tab) if (a.in != 'ok') ng.push(a.hn.split('<a href=\\\"').slice(-1)[0].split('\\\">')[0]); ng`\n\n* send the list of filenames to copyparty for safekeeping:  \n  `await fetch('/inc', {method:'PUT', body:JSON.stringify(ng,null,1)})`\n\n\n# HTTP API\n\nsee [devnotes](./docs/devnotes.md#http-api)\n\n\n# dependencies\n\nmandatory deps:\n* `jinja2` (is built into the SFX)\n\n\n## optional dependencies\n\ninstall these to enable bonus features\n\nenable hashed passwords in config: `argon2-cffi`\n\nenable ftp-server:\n* for just plaintext FTP, `pyftpdlib` (is built into the SFX)\n* with TLS encryption, `pyftpdlib pyopenssl`\n\nenable music tags:\n* either `mutagen` (fast, pure-python, skips a few tags, makes copyparty GPL? idk)\n* or `ffprobe` (20x slower, more accurate, possibly dangerous depending on your distro and users)\n\nenable [thumbnails](#thumbnails) of...\n* **images:** `Pillow` and/or `pyvips` and/or `ffmpeg` (requires py2.7 or py3.5+)\n* **videos/audio:** `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` somewhere in `$PATH`\n* **HEIF pictures:** `pyvips` or `ffmpeg` or `pyheif-pillow-opener` (requires Linux or a C compiler)\n* **AVIF pictures:** `pyvips` or `ffmpeg` or `pillow-avif-plugin`\n* **JPEG XL pictures:** `pyvips` or `ffmpeg`\n\nenable [smb](#smb-server) support (**not** recommended):\n* `impacket==0.12.0`\n\n`pyvips` gives higher quality thumbnails than `Pillow` and is 320% faster, using 270% more ram: `sudo apt install libvips42 && python3 -m pip install --user -U pyvips`\n\n\n### dependency chickenbits\n\nprevent loading an optional dependency  , for example if:\n\n* you have an incompatible version installed and it causes problems\n* you just don't want copyparty to use it, maybe to save ram\n\nset any of the following environment variables to disable its associated optional feature,\n\n| env-var              | what it does |\n| -------------------- | ------------ |\n| `PRTY_NO_ARGON2`     | disable argon2-cffi password hashing |\n| `PRTY_NO_CFSSL`      | never attempt to generate self-signed certificates using [cfssl](https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl) |\n| `PRTY_NO_FFMPEG`     | **audio transcoding** goes byebye, **thumbnailing** must be handled by Pillow/libvips |\n| `PRTY_NO_FFPROBE`    | **audio transcoding** goes byebye, **thumbnailing** must be handled by Pillow/libvips, **metadata-scanning** must be handled by mutagen |\n| `PRTY_NO_MUTAGEN`    | do not use [mutagen](https://pypi.org/project/mutagen/) for reading metadata from media files;

see [./docs/devnotes.md#sfx-repack](./docs/devnotes.md#sfx-repack)\n\n\n## copyparty.exe\n\ndownload [copyparty.exe](https://github.com/9001/copyparty/releases/latest/download/copyparty.exe) (win8+) or [copyparty32.exe](https://github.com/9001/copyparty/releases/latest/download/copyparty32.exe) (win7+)\n\n![copyparty-exe-fs8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/241032/221445946-1e328e56-8c5b-44a9-8b9f-dee84d942535.png)\n\ncan be convenient on machines where installing python is problematic, however is **not recommended** -- if possible, please use **[copyparty-sfx.py](https://github.com/9001/copyparty/releases/latest/download/copyparty-sfx.py)** instead\n\n* [copyparty.exe](https://github.com/9001/copyparty/releases/latest/download/copyparty.exe) runs on win8 or newer, was compiled on win10, does thumbnails + media tags, and is *currently* safe to use, but any future python/expat/pillow CVEs can only be remedied by downloading a newer version of the exe\n\n  * on win8 it needs [vc redist 2015](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145), on win10 it just works\n  * some antivirus may freak out (false-positive), possibly [Avast, AVG, and McAfee](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/52391a1e9842cf70ad243ef83844d46d29c0044d101ee0138fcdd3c8de2237d6/detection)\n\n* dangerous: [copyparty32.exe](https://github.com/9001/copyparty/releases/latest/download/copyparty32.exe) is compatible with [windows7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/241032/221445944-ae85d1f4-d351-4837-b130-82cab57d6cca.png), which means it uses an ancient copy of python (3.7.9) which cannot be upgraded and should never be exposed to the internet (LAN is fine)\n\n* dangerous and deprecated: [copyparty-winpe64.exe](https://github.com/9001/copyparty/releases/download/v1.8.7/copyparty-winpe64.exe) lets you [run copyparty in WinPE](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/241032/205454984-e6b550df-3c49-486d-9267-1614078dd0dd.png) and is otherwise completely useless\n\nmeanwhile [copyparty-sfx.py](https://github.com/9001/copyparty/releases/latest/download/copyparty-sfx.py) instead relies on your system python which gives better performance and will stay safe as long as you keep your python install up-to-date\n\nthen again, if you are already into downloading shady binaries from the internet, you may also want my [minimal builds](./scripts/pyinstaller#ffmpeg) of [ffmpeg](https://ocv.me/stuff/bin/ffmpeg.exe) and [ffprobe](https://ocv.me/stuff/bin/ffprobe.exe) which enables copyparty to extract multimedia-info, do audio-transcoding, and thumbnails/spectrograms/waveforms, however it's much better to instead grab a [recent official build](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-git-full.7z) every once ina while if you can afford the size\n\n\n## zipapp\n\nanother emergency alternative, [copyparty.pyz](https://github.com/9001/copyparty/releases/latest/download/copyparty.pyz)  has less features, is slow, requires python 3.7 or newer, worse compression, and more importantly is unable to benefit from more recent versions of jinja2 and such (which makes it less secure)... lots of drawbacks with this one really -- but it does not unpack any temporary files to disk, so it *may* just work if the regular sfx fails to start because the computer is messed up in certain funky ways, so it's worth a shot if all else fails\n\nrun it by doubleclicking it, or try typing `python copyparty.pyz` in your terminal/console/commandline/telex if that fails\n\nit is a python [zipapp](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipapp.html) meaning it doesn't have to unpack its own python code anywhere to run, so if the filesystem is busted it has a better chance of getting somewhere\n* but note that it currently still needs to extract the web-resources somewhere (they'll land in the default TEMP-folder of your OS)\n\n\n# install on android\n\ninstall [Termux](https://termux.com/) + its companion app `Termux:API` (see [ocv.me/termux](https://ocv.me/termux/)) and then copy-paste this into Termux (long-tap) all at once:\n```sh\nyes | pkg upgrade && termux-setup-storage && yes | pkg install python termux-api && python -m ensurepip && python -m pip install --user -U copyparty && { grep -qE 'PATH=.*\\.local/bin' ~/.bashrc 2>/dev/null || { echo 'PATH=\"$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc && . ~/.bashrc; }; }\necho $?\n```\n\nafter the initial setup, you can launch copyparty at any time by running `copyparty` anywhere in Termux -- and if you run it with `--qr` you'll get a [neat qr-code](#qr-code) pointing to your external ip\n\nif you want thumbnails (photos+videos) and you're okay with spending another 132 MiB of storage, `pkg install ffmpeg && python3 -m pip install --user -U pillow`\n\n* or if you want to use `vips` for photo-thumbs instead, `pkg install libvips && python -m pip install --user -U wheel && python -m pip install --user -U pyvips && (cd /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/lib/; ln -s libgobject-2.0.so{,.0}; ln -s libvips.so{,.42})`\n\n\n# reporting bugs\n\nideas for context to include, and where to submit them\n\nplease get in touch using any of the following URLs:\n* https://github.com/9001/copyparty/ **(primary)**\n* https://gitlab.com/9001/copyparty/ *(mirror)*\n* https://codeberg.org/9001/copyparty *(mirror)*\n\nin general, commandline arguments (and config file if any)\n\nif something broke during an upload (replacing FILENAME with a part of the filename that broke):\n```\njournalctl -aS '48 hour ago' -u copyparty | grep -C10 FILENAME | tee bug.log\n```\n\nif there's a wall of base64 in the log (thread stacks) then please include that, especially if you run into something freezing up or getting stuck, for example `OperationalError('database is locked')` -- alternatively you can visit `/?stack` to see the stacks live, so http://127.0.0.1:3923/?stack for example\n\n\n# devnotes\n\nfor build instructions etc, see [./docs/devnotes.md](./docs/devnotes.md)\n\nsee [./docs/TODO.md](./docs/TODO.md) for planned features / fixes / changes\n\n",

You can be the next one - read our\n[Contribution Guide](https://github.com/indico/indico/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you'd like to help out.\n\n**You don't need to know how to write code in order to help!**\n\n## Roadmap\n\nThe full roadmap is [available on the project site](https://getindico.io/roadmap/).\n\n## Community\n\nThe main meeting points for the community are:\n * the [Project Forum](https://talk.getindico.io);\n * the Chat Room\n([#indico on Libera.Chat](https://web.libera.chat/gamja/?channels=#indico) or on [Matrix](https://app.element.io/#/room/#indico:matrix.org)).\n\nWe follow [CERN's Values](https://hr.web.cern.ch/cerns-values) and the principles established by\n[CERN's Code of Conduct](https://hr.web.cern.ch/codeofconduct).\n\n## History\n\nThis software project was initially funded by the European Union's FP5 programme🇪🇺, in what was called the [**In**tegrated **Di**gital **Co**nferencing Project](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/61849/factsheet/en), or just **InDiCo**. CERN was responsible for the development of the \"Make-a-Confererence\" workpackage (inspired by an already existing system called **CDS Agenda**, also developed at the Organization) which would then become what we nowadays know as **Indico**.\n\nWe have since stopped using the ~~*InDiCo*~~ acronym, as it no longer reflects accurately the nature of the project. The word *Indico* now has no particular meaning other than the product's name.\n\n\n---\n\n\n|||\n|-|-|\n|<a href=\"https://home.cern\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/indico/assets/master/cern_badge.png\" width=\"64\"></a>|Made at [CERN](https://home.cern)<br>[Take part!](https://careers.cern/)|\n|||\n\n> ### Note\n>\n> *In applying the MIT license, CERN does not waive the privileges and immunities\n> granted to it by virtue of its status as an Intergovernmental Organization\n> or submit itself to any jurisdiction.*\n",

Continuous integration fails under 100% branch coverage.\n\n2. **Simplicity**: all you need to understand is ``msg = await ws.recv()`` and\n   ``await ws.send(msg)``. ``websockets`` takes care of managing connections\n   so you can focus on your application.\n\n3. **Robustness**: ``websockets`` is built for production. For example, it was\n   the only library to `handle backpressure correctly`_ before the issue\n   became widely known in the Python community.\n\n4. **Performance**: memory usage is optimized and configurable. A C extension\n   accelerates expensive operations. It's pre-compiled for Linux, macOS and\n   Windows and packaged in the wheel format for each system and Python version.\n\nDocumentation is a first class concern in the project. Head over to `Read the\nDocs`_ and see for yourself.\n\n.. _Read the Docs: https://websockets.readthedocs.io/\n.. _handle backpressure correctly: https://vorpus.org/blog/some-thoughts-on-asynchronous-api-design-in-a-post-asyncawait-world/#websocket-servers\n\nWhy shouldn't I use ``websockets``?\n-----------------------------------\n\n* If you prefer callbacks over coroutines: ``websockets`` was created to\n  provide the best coroutine-based API to manage WebSocket connections in\n  Python. Pick another library for a callback-based API.\n\n* If you're looking for a mixed HTTP / WebSocket library: ``websockets`` aims\n  at being an excellent implementation of :rfc:`6455`: The WebSocket Protocol\n  and :rfc:`7692`: Compression Extensions for WebSocket. Its support for HTTP\n  is minimal — just enough for an HTTP health check.\n\n  If you want to do both in the same server, look at HTTP frameworks that\n  build on top of ``websockets`` to support WebSocket connections, like\n  Sanic_.\n\n.. _Sanic: https://sanicframework.org/en/\n\nWhat else?\n----------\n\nBug reports, patches and suggestions are welcome!\n\nTo report a security vulnerability, please use the `Tidelift security\ncontact`_.

Should there be\na possible vector or consideration missing, please contact the maintainers, as described\nbelow.\n\nWe use [pre-signed POST URLs](s3-pre-signed-url) to upload files to AWS S3.\n[Django's internal signer](django-signing) is used to sign the upload path and validate\nit before fetching files from S3.\n\nPlease note, that Django's signer uses the `SECRET_KEY`, rotating the key will void all\nsignatures. Should you rotate the secret key, between a form GET and POST request, the\nform will fail. Similarly, Django will expire all sessions if you rotate the key.\n\n[s3-pre-signed-url]: https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/s3-presigned-urls.html\n[django-signing]: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/signing/\n\n### Upload of malicious files\n\nAWS S3 supports MIME type detection and content-type enforcement.\nYou can limit the upload of malicious files via the MIME type [accept][accept].\nHowever, this is not a security measure, and you should always validate files before\nprocessing them.\n\n[accept]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/accept\n\n### Request file injection\n\nThough files can always be included in a request, CVE-2022-24840 revealed that we need\nto consider people injecting any files that reside on your S3 bucket. However, we do\npresign the upload location and validate it before fetching files from S3.\n\n### Path traversal & timing attacks\n\nWe fetch files from your S3 bucket. This behavior could be used to brute force valid\nfile names. We mitigate this by signing the allowed upload path and validating it.\nThe upload path is unique for each file input and request. Therefore, an attacker can\nnot escape and access any files but the one uploaded by the attacker.\n\n## Reporting a Vulnerability\n\nNEVER open an issue or discussion to report a vulnerability.\n\nTo report a security vulnerability, please use the\n[Tidelift security contact](https://tidelift.com/security).\nTidelift will coordinate the fix and disclosure.\n\nYou may also contact one of the maintainers of the project either via email or Telegram:\n\n* Email: [johannes@maron.family](mailto:johannes@maron.family)\n* Telegram: [@codingjoe](https://t.me/codingjoe)\n",

        "README_content": "# django-s3file\n\nA lightweight file upload input for Django and Amazon S3.\n\nDjango-S3File allows you to upload files directly AWS S3 effectively\nbypassing your application server. This allows you to avoid long running\nrequests from large file uploads. This is particularly helpful for if\nyou run your service on AWS Lambda or Heroku where you have a hard\nrequest limit.\n\n[![PyPi\nVersion](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/django-s3file.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-s3file/)\n[![Test\nCoverage](https://codecov.io/gh/codingjoe/django-s3file/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/codingjoe/django-s3file)\n[![GitHub\nlicense](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codingjoe/django-s3file/main/LICENSE)\n\n## Features\n\n-   lightweight: less 200 lines\n-   no JavaScript or Python dependencies (no jQuery)\n-   easy integration\n-   works just like the built-in\n-   extendable JavaScript API\n\n## For the Nerds\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    autonumber\n    actor Browser\n    participant S3\n    participant Middleware\n    Browser->>Django: GET form view\n    activate Django\n    Django->>Browser: RESPONSE w/ presigned POST URL & signed middleware key\n    deactivate Django\n    Browser->>S3: POST large file\n    activate S3\n    S3->>Browser: RESPONSE AWS S3 key\n    Browser->>Middleware: POST AWS S3 key (signed)\n    activate Middleware\n    Middleware->>S3: GET AWS S3 key\n    S3->>Middleware: RESPONSE large file promise\n    deactivate S3\n    Middleware->>Django: request incl. large file promise\n    deactivate Middleware\n    activate Django\n    opt only if files is procssed by Django\n        Django-->>S3: GET large file\n        activate S3\n        S3-->>Django: RESPONSE large file\n        deactivate S3\n    end\n    Django->>Browser: RESPONSE success\n    deactivate Django\n```\n\nIn a nutshell, we can bypass Django completely and have AWS handle\nthe upload or any processing. Of course, if you want to do something\nwith your file in Django, you can do so, just like before, with the\nadded advantage, that your file is served from within your datacenter.\n\n## Installation\n\nMake sure you have [Amazon S3\nstorage](http://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends/amazon-S3.html)\nsetup correctly.\n\nJust install S3file using `pip`.\n\n```bash\npip install django-s3file\n# or\npipenv install django-s3file\n```\n\nAdd the S3File app and middleware in your settings:\n\n```python\n# settings.py\n\nINSTALLED_APPS = (\n    '...',\n    's3file',\n    '...',\n)\n\nMIDDLEWARE = (\n    '...',\n    's3file.middleware.S3FileMiddleware',\n    '...',\n)\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nS3File automatically replaces Django's `ClearableFileInput` widget, you\ndo not need to alter your code at all.\n\nThe `ClearableFileInput` widget is only than automatically replaced when\nthe `STORAGES[\"default\"]` setting is set to `django-storages`'\n`S3Boto3Storage` or the dummy `FileSystemStorage` is enabled.\n\n### Setting up the AWS S3 bucket\n\n#### Upload folder\n\nS3File uploads to a single folder. Files are later moved by Django when\nthey are saved to the `upload_to` location.\n\nIt is recommended to [setup\nexpiration](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/intro-lifecycle-rules.html)\nfor that folder, to ensure that old and unused file uploads don't add up\nand produce costs.\n\nThe default folder name is: `tmp/s3file` You can change it by changing\nthe `S3FILE_UPLOAD_PATH` setting.\n\n#### CORS policy\n\nYou will need to allow `POST` from all origins. Just add the following\nto your CORS policy.\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"AllowedHeaders\": [\n        \"*\"\n    ],\n    \"AllowedMethods\": [\n        \"POST\"\n    ],\n    \"AllowedOrigins\": [\n        \"*\"\n    ],\n    \"ExposeHeaders\": [],\n    \"MaxAgeSeconds\": 3000\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Progress Bar\n\nS3File does emit progress signals that can be used to display some kind\nof progress bar. Signals named `progress` are emitted for both each\nindividual file input as well as for the form as a whole.\n\nThe progress signal carries the following details:\n\n```javascript\nconsole.log(event.detail)\n\n{\n    progress: 0.4725307607171312  // total upload progress of either a form or single input\n    loaded: 1048576  // total upload progress of either a form or single input\n    total: 2219064  // total bytes to upload\n    currentFile: File {…}  // file object\n    currentFileName: \"text.txt\"  // file name of the file currently uploaded\n    currentFileProgress: 0.47227834703299176  // upload progress of that file\n    originalEvent: ProgressEvent {…} // the original XHR onprogress event\n}\n```\n\nThe following example implements a Boostrap progress bar for upload\nprogress of an entire form.\n\n```html\n<div class=\"progress\">\n  <div class=\"progress-bar\" role=\"progressbar\" style=\"width: 0%;\" aria-valuenow=\"0\" aria-valuemin=\"0\" aria-valuemax=\"100\">0%</div>\n</div>\n```\n\n```javascript\n(function () {\n    var form = document.getElementsByTagName('form')[0]\n    var progressBar = document.getElementsByClassName('progress-bar')[0]\n\n    form.addEventListener('progress', function (event) {\n        // event.detail.progress is a value between 0 and 1\n        var percent = Math.round(event.detail.progress * 100)\n\n        progressBar.setAttribute('style', 'width:' + percent + '%')\n        progressBar.setAttribute('aria-valuenow', percent)\n        progressBar.innerText = percent + '%'\n    })\n})()\n```\n\n### Using S3File in development\n\nUsing S3File in development can be helpful especially if you want to use\nthe progress signals described above. Therefore, S3File comes with a AWS\nS3 dummy backend. It behaves similar to the real S3 storage backend. It\nis automatically enabled, if the `DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE` setting is set\nto `FileSystemStorage`.\n\nTo prevent users from accidentally using the `FileSystemStorage` and the\ninsecure S3 dummy backend in production, there is also an additional\ndeployment check that will error if you run Django\\'s deployment check\nsuite:\n\n```shell\npython manage.py check --deploy\n```\n\nWe recommend always running the deployment check suite as part of your\ndeployment pipeline.\n\n### Uploading multiple files\n\nDjango does have limited support for [uploading multiple\nfiles](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/http/file-uploads/#uploading-multiple-files).\nS3File fully supports this feature. The custom middleware makes ensure\nthat files are accessible via `request.FILES`, even though they have\nbeen uploaded to AWS S3 directly and not to your Django application\nserver.\n\n### Using optimized S3Boto3Storage\n\nSince `S3Boto3Storage` supports storing data from any other fileobj, it\nuses a generalized `_save` function. This leads to the frontend\nuploading the file to S3 and then copying it byte-by-byte to perform a\nmove operation just to rename the uploaded object. For large files this\nleads to additional loading times for the user.\n\nThat\\'s why S3File provides an optimized version of this method at\n`storages_optimized.S3OptimizedUploadStorage`. It uses the more\nefficient `copy` method from S3, given that we know that we only copy\nfrom one S3 location to another.\n\n```python\nfrom s3file.storages_optimized import S3OptimizedUploadStorage\n\nclass MyStorage(S3OptimizedUploadStorage):  # Subclass and use like any other storage\n    default_acl = 'private'\n```\n",

To initiate a task a client puts a\nmessage on the queue, the broker then delivers the message to a worker.\n\nA Celery system can consist of multiple workers and brokers, giving way\nto high availability and horizontal scaling.\n\nCelery is written in Python, but the protocol can be implemented in any\nlanguage. In addition to Python there's node-celery_ for Node.js,\na `PHP client`_, `gocelery`_, gopher-celery_ for Go, and rusty-celery_ for Rust.\n\nLanguage interoperability can also be achieved by using webhooks\nin such a way that the client enqueues an URL to be requested by a worker.\n\n.. _node-celery: https://github.com/mher/node-celery\n.. _`PHP client`: https://github.com/gjedeer/celery-php\n.. _`gocelery`: https://github.com/gocelery/gocelery\n.. _gopher-celery: https://github.com/marselester/gopher-celery\n.. _rusty-celery: https://github.com/rusty-celery/rusty-celery\n\nWhat do I need?\n===============\n\nCelery version 5.5.x runs on:\n\n- Python (3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13)\n- PyPy3.9+ (v7.3.12+)\n\n\nThis is the version of celery which will support Python 3.8 or newer.\n\nIf you're running an older version of Python, you need to be running\nan older version of Celery:\n\n- Python 3.7: Celery 5.2 or earlier.\n- Python 3.6: Celery 5.1 or earlier.\n- Python 2.7: Celery 4.x series.\n- Python 2.6: Celery series 3.1 or earlier.\n- Python 2.5: Celery series 3.0 or earlier.\n- Python 2.4: Celery series 2.2 or earlier.\n\nCelery is a project with minimal funding,\nso we don't support Microsoft Windows but it should be working.\nPlease don't open any issues related to that platform.\n\n*Celery* is usually used with a message broker to send and receive messages.\nThe RabbitMQ, Redis transports are feature complete,\nbut there's also experimental support for a myriad of other solutions, including\nusing SQLite for local development.\n\n*Celery* can run on a single machine, on multiple machines, or even\nacross datacenters.\n\nGet Started\n===========\n\nIf this is the first time you're trying to use Celery, or you're\nnew to Celery v5.5.x coming from previous versions then you should read our\ngetting started tutorials:\n\n- `First steps with Celery`_\n\n    Tutorial teaching you the bare minimum needed to get started with Celery.\n\n- `Next steps`_\n\n    A more complete overview, showing more features.\n\n.. _`First steps with Celery`:\n    https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/getting-started/first-steps-with-celery.html\n\n.. _`Next steps`:\n    https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/getting-started/next-steps.html\n\n You can also get started with Celery by using a hosted broker transport CloudAMQP. The largest hosting provider of RabbitMQ is a proud sponsor of Celery.\n\nCelery is...\n=============\n\n- **Simple**\n\n    Celery is easy to use and maintain, and does *not need configuration files*.\n\n    It has an active, friendly community you can talk to for support,\n    like at our `mailing-list`_, or the IRC channel.\n\n    Here's one of the simplest applications you can make:\n\n    .. code-block:: python\n\n        from celery import Celery\n\n        app = Celery('hello', broker='amqp://guest@localhost//')\n\n        @app.task\n        def hello():\n            return 'hello world'\n\n- **Highly Available**\n\n    Workers and clients will automatically retry in the event\n    of connection loss or failure, and some brokers support\n    HA in way of *Primary/Primary* or *Primary/Replica* replication.\n\n- **Fast**\n\n    A single Celery process can process millions of tasks a minute,\n    with sub-millisecond round-trip latency (using RabbitMQ,\n    py-librabbitmq, and optimized settings).\n\n- **Flexible**\n\n    Almost every part of *Celery* can be extended or used on its own,\n    Custom pool implementations, serializers, compression schemes, logging,\n    schedulers, consumers, producers, broker transports, and much more.\n\nIt supports...\n================\n\n    - **Message Transports**\n\n        - RabbitMQ_, Redis_, Amazon SQS, Google Pub/Sub\n\n    - **Concurrency**\n\n        - Prefork, Eventlet_, gevent_, single threaded (``solo``)\n\n    - **Result Stores**\n\n        - AMQP, Redis\n        - memcached\n        - SQLAlchemy, Django ORM\n        - Apache Cassandra, IronCache, Elasticsearch\n        - Google Cloud Storage\n\n    - **Serialization**\n\n        - *pickle*, *json*, *yaml*, *msgpack*.\n        - *zlib*, *bzip2* compression.\n        - Cryptographic message signing.\n\n.. _`Eventlet`: http://eventlet.net/\n.. _`gevent`: http://gevent.org/\n\n.. _RabbitMQ: https://rabbitmq.com\n.. _Redis: https://redis.io\n.. _SQLAlchemy: http://sqlalchemy.org\n\nFramework Integration\n=====================\n\nCelery is easy to integrate with web frameworks, some of which even have\nintegration packages:\n\n    +--------------------+------------------------+\n    | `Django`_          | not needed             |\n    +--------------------+------------------------+\n    | `Pyramid`_         | `pyramid_celery`_      |\n    +--------------------+------------------------+\n    | `Pylons`_          | `celery-pylons`_       |\n    +--------------------+------------------------+\n    | `Flask`_           | not needed             |\n    +--------------------+------------------------+\n    | `web2py`_          | `web2py-celery`_       |\n    +--------------------+------------------------+\n    | `Tornado`_         | `tornado-celery`_      |\n    +--------------------+------------------------+\n    | `FastAPI`_         | not needed             |\n    +--------------------+------------------------+\n\nThe integration packages aren't strictly necessary, but they can make\ndevelopment easier, and sometimes they add important hooks like closing\ndatabase connections at ``fork``.\n\n.. _`Django`: https://djangoproject.com/\n.. _`Pylons`: http://pylonsproject.org/\n.. _`Flask`: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/\n.. _`web2py`: http://web2py.com/\n.. _`Bottle`: https://bottlepy.org/\n.. _`Pyramid`: https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/\n.. _`pyramid_celery`: https://pypi.org/project/pyramid_celery/\n.. _`celery-pylons`: https://pypi.org/project/celery-pylons/\n.. _`web2py-celery`: https://code.google.com/p/web2py-celery/\n.. _`Tornado`: https://www.tornadoweb.org/\n.. _`tornado-celery`: https://github.com/mher/tornado-celery/\n.. _`FastAPI`: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/\n\n.. _celery-documentation:\n\nDocumentation\n=============\n\nThe `latest documentation`_ is hosted at Read The Docs, containing user guides,\ntutorials, and an API reference.\n\n.. _`latest documentation`: https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/latest/\n\n.. _celery-installation:\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nYou can install Celery either via the Python Package Index (PyPI)\nor from source.\n\nTo install using ``pip``:\n\n::\n\n\n    $ pip install -U Celery\n\n.. _bundles:\n\nBundles\n-------\n\nCelery also defines a group of bundles that can be used\nto install Celery and the dependencies for a given feature.\n\nYou can specify these in your requirements or on the ``pip``\ncommand-line by using brackets.

Alternatively, you may email\n[security@palletsprojects.com](mailto:security@palletsprojects.com), and we will\nconvert that to a GitHub security advisory.\n\nBe sure to include as much detail as necessary in your report. As with reporting\nnormal issues, a minimal reproducible example will help the maintainers address\nthe issue faster. Information about why the issue is a security issue is also\nhelpful. If you are able, you may also provide a fix for the issue.\n\nA maintainer will reply acknowledging the report and how to continue. We will\nobtain a CVE id as well, please do not do this on your own. We will work with\nyou to attempt to understand the issue and decide on its validity. Maintainers\nare volunteers working in their free time, and therefore cannot guarantee any\nspecific timeline. Please be patient during this process.\n\nThe current feature release will receive security fixes. Fixes to older versions\nmay be considered based on usage information and severity, but are not\nguaranteed. After fixing an issue, we will make a new release.\n\n[gh-docs]: https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/creating-a-repository-security-advisory\n",

These are some of the main features:\n\n1. Highly flexible classes for the representation of `Element`, `Site`, `Molecule` and `Structure` objects.\n2. Extensive input/output support, including support for [VASP](https://cms.mpi.univie.ac.at/vasp), [ABINIT](https://abinit.org), [CIF](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallographic_Information_File), [Gaussian](https://gaussian.com), [XYZ](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/XYZ_file_format), and many other file formats.\n3. Powerful analysis tools, including generation of phase diagrams, Pourbaix diagrams, diffusion analyses, reactions, etc.\n4. Electronic structure analyses, such as density of states and band structure.\n5. Integration with the [Materials Project] REST API.\n\nPymatgen is free to use. However, we also welcome your help to improve this library by making your contributions. These contributions can be in the form of additional tools or modules you develop, or feature requests and bug reports. The following are resources for `pymatgen`:\n\n- [Official documentation][`pymatgen` docs]\n- Bug reports or feature requests: Please submit a [GitHub issue].\n- Code contributions via [pull request] are welcome.\n- For questions that are not bugs or feature requests, please use the `pymatgen` [MatSci forum](https://matsci.org/pymatgen) or open a [GitHub discussion].\n- [`matgenb`](https://github.com/materialsvirtuallab/matgenb#introduction) provides some example Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how to use `pymatgen` functionality.\n\n[pull request]: https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen/pulls\n[github issue]: https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen/issues\n[github discussion]: https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen/discussions\n\n## Why use `pymatgen`?\n\n1. **It is (fairly) robust.** Pymatgen is used by thousands of researchers and is the analysis code powering the [Materials Project]. The analysis it produces survives rigorous scrutiny every single day. Bugs tend to be found and corrected quickly. Pymatgen also uses Github Actions for continuous integration, which ensures that every new code passes a comprehensive suite of unit tests.\n2. **It is well documented.** A fairly comprehensive documentation has been written to help you get to grips with it quickly.\n3. **It is open.** You are free to use and contribute to `pymatgen`. It also means that `pymatgen` is continuously being improved. We will attribute any code you contribute to any publication you specify. Contributing to `pymatgen` means your research becomes more visible, which translates to greater impact.\n4. **It is fast.** Many of the core numerical methods in `pymatgen` have been optimized by vectorizing in `numpy`/`scipy`. This means that coordinate manipulations are fast. Pymatgen also comes with a complete system for handling periodic boundary conditions.\n5. **It will be around.** Pymatgen is not a pet research project. It is used in the well-established Materials Project. It is also actively being developed and maintained by the [Materials Virtual Lab], the ABINIT group and many other research groups.\n6. **A growing ecosystem of developers and add-ons**. Pymatgen has contributions from materials scientists all over the world. We also now have an architecture to support add-ons that expand `pymatgen`'s functionality even further. Check out the [contributing page](https://pymatgen.org/contributing) and [add-ons page](https://pymatgen.org/addons) for details and examples.\n\n## Installation\n\nThe version at the Python Package Index [PyPI] is always the latest stable release that is relatively bug-free and can be installed via `pip`:\n\n[pypi]: https://pypi.org/project/pymatgen\n\n```sh\npip install pymatgen\n```\n\nIf you'd like to use the latest unreleased changes on the main branch, you can install directly from GitHub:\n\n```sh\npip install -U git+https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen\n```\n\nThe minimum Python version is 3.10. Some extra functionality (e.g., generation of POTCARs) does require additional setup (see the [`pymatgen` docs]).\n\n## Change Log\n\nSee [GitHub releases](https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen/releases), [`docs/CHANGES.md`](docs/CHANGES.md) or [commit history](https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen/commits/master) in increasing order of details.\n\n## Using pymatgen\n\nPlease refer to the official [`pymatgen` docs] for tutorials and examples.\n\n## How to cite pymatgen\n\nIf you use `pymatgen` in your research, please consider citing the following work:\n\n> Shyue Ping Ong, William Davidson Richards, Anubhav Jain, Geoffroy\n> Hautier, Michael Kocher, Shreyas Cholia, Dan Gunter, Vincent Chevrier,\n> Kristin A. Persson, Gerbrand Ceder. *Python Materials Genomics\n> (pymatgen): A Robust, Open-Source Python Library for Materials\n> Analysis.* Computational Materials Science, 2013, 68, 314-319.\n> [doi:10.1016/j.commatsci.2012.10.028](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.commatsci.2012.10.028)\n\nIn addition, some of `pymatgen`'s functionality is based on scientific advances/principles developed by the computational materials scientists in our team. Please refer to the [`pymatgen` docs] on how to cite them.\n\n### Soliciting contributions to 2nd `pymatgen` paper\n\nIf you are a long-standing `pymatgen` contributor and would like to be involved in working on an updated `pymatgen` publication,\nplease fill out this [co-author registration form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSecIhD2YjdPGldrRTM8Go3VxVg_vjKjZAOXtIKDG7qckHLYaQ/viewform) or contact [@shyuep, @mkhorton and @janosh](mailto:ongsp@ucsd.edu,m.k.horton@gmail.com,janosh@lbl.gov?subject=Contributing%20to%20updated%20pymatgen%20paper) with questions.\n\n## License\n\nPymatgen is released under the MIT License.

Instead, safer alternatives are employed to achieve the same functionality without compromising security. This PR encompasses modifications across several files within the project, specifically targeting areas where `eval` was previously used and replacing it with `literal_eval` or other safer methods. Additionally, the PR introduces minor formatting tweaks to improve the readability and consistency of the code. These changes span across multiple modules, including `pymatgen/analysis/magnetism/heisenberg.py`, `pymatgen/electronic_structure/boltztrap2.py`, and `pymatgen/io/vasp/inputs.py`, indicating a broad and impactful set of improvements aimed at enhancing the code's overall quality and security posture.\n\n### AI-generated Summary of Generated Summaries\n\nThe Pull Request introduces several key changes across different modules to improve security, readability, and efficiency. Notably, the unsafe `eval` function has been replaced with `literal_eval` in the `from_dict` class method within `pymatgen/analysis/magnetism/heisenberg.py`, directly addressing the primary objective of enhancing security. This module also sees adjustments in loop logic, condition simplifications, and the optimization of tolerance value handling and duplicate removals, contributing to cleaner and more efficient code.\n\nIn `pymatgen/electronic_structure/boltztrap2.py`, the changes focus on refining the logic related to spin polarization and structural assignments, alongside methodological refinements in property access and calculation processes. These modifications streamline the handling of spin-polarized calculations and improve the clarity and performance of property plotting and band analysis methods.\n\nThe `pymatgen/io/vasp/inputs.py` module experiences enhancements in parameter type checking, utilizing the walrus operator for more concise assignment operations, and the removal of unnecessary integer value handling for hashing. Additionally, the documentation for the `__iter__` method in the `Potcar` class has been clarified, aiding in better understanding and usage of the method.\n\nCollectively, these changes across the three modules not only address the critical security concerns associated with the use of `eval` but also introduce several optimizations and clarifications that contribute to the overall maintainability, readability, and efficiency of the codebase. The PR effectively moves the project away from potentially hazardous practices while streamlining various aspects of the code, demonstrating a comprehensive approach to improving the project's quality and security.\n\n-->\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: short summary by coderabbit.ai --><!-- commit_ids_reviewed_start -->\n\n<!-- 5ca3aff1b81589ca37b03279f1cf6a3f716a4085 -->\n\n<!-- commit_ids_reviewed_end --><!-- tweet_start -->\n\nThank you for using CodeRabbit.

Changes include adopting Unicode encoding, refining dictionary operations, ensuring default values, enhancing assignments for clarity, and optimizing file processing for efficiency.\n\n## Changes\n\n| Files | Summary |\n|-------|---------|\n| `pymatgen/io/lammps/data.py`, `pymatgen/io/lammps/inputs.py` | - Added `encoding=\"utf-8\"` in file operations.<br>- Simplified dictionary updates.<br>- Managed default values for specific data fields.<br>- Clarified variable assignments for improved readability.<br>- Optimized file parsing and error handling. |\n| `pymatgen/io/lammps/outputs.py` | - Updated file sorting based on a pattern.<br>- Adjusted regular expression handling for file access. |\n\n> 🐇✨  \n> To the code we hop and leap,  \n> Through the files, our changes seep.  \n> With each line, we aim to enhance,  \n> Unicode and syntax dance.  \n> A rabbit's touch, so light and deft,  \n> Leaves the codebase improved and left.  \n> 🌟📄🚀\n\n<!-- walkthrough_end --><!-- This is an auto-generated comment: raw summary by coderabbit.ai -->\n<!--\n\n\npymatgen/io/lammps/data.py: ## Short summary\n\n- Added `encoding=\"utf-8\"` parameter in `open` function calls.\n- Changed dictionary update syntax from `body.update({name: section})` to `body[name] = section`.\n- Modified the handling of `topo.charges` to use a default value if `topo.charges` is empty.\n- Updated assignment of `self.force_field` to use `ff_dfs or None` for clarity.\n- Revised the `from_files` method to handle file parsing and clustering more efficiently.\n- Improved error handling for different atom styles in files.\n- Updated type annotations in `from_files` method parameters.\n\npymatgen/io/lammps/inputs.py: ### Short Summary\n\n- In the `ncomments` method, the variable `_args` is used instead of `args` in the list comprehension.\n- In the `merge_stages` method, the condition is changed to check if any stage is not in `self.stages_names` instead of all stages.\n- In the `from_str` method, the construction of the `header` variable is optimized using a list comprehension.\n- In the `_add_comment` method, the condition for inline comments is simplified.\n- In the `md` method, the file is opened with explicit encoding specified.\n- In the `write_lammps_inputs` method, the assignment of `data_filename` is updated using the walrus operator.\n\npymatgen/io/lammps/outputs.py: ### Short Summary\n\nIn the `pymatgen/io/lammps/outputs.py` file, the changes involve modifying how files are sorted based on a pattern and accessing matched groups in regular expressions. Specifically, the sorting of files based on a key function and accessing matched groups in regular expressions have been adjusted to simplify the code logic.\n\n-->\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: raw summary by coderabbit.ai --><!-- This is an auto-generated comment: short summary by coderabbit.ai -->\n<!--\n\n\n### PR Objectives\n\nPR #3736 aims to bolster security and code quality in the `pymatgen` library by eliminating the use of `exec`, particularly from untrusted sources like external filenames, to mitigate security risks such as the `xz` backdoor. Additionally, minor enhancements suggested by `sourcery` are applied to refine the codebase.\n\n### Comments Summary\n\n- Request for review by `DanielYang59` directed to `@janosh`.\n- Code changes in `pymatgen/io/lammps/data.py`, `pymatgen/io/lammps/inputs.py`, and `pymatgen/io/lammps/outputs.py` include:\n  - Standardizing file operations with `encoding=\"utf-8\"`.\n  - Refactoring dictionary updates for clarity.\n  - Improving default value handling for specific cases.\n  - Enhancing code readability and error handling.\n  - Optimizing methods for efficiency and error prevention.\n\n### AI-generated Summary of Generated Summaries\n\nKey changes in PR #3736 for `pymatgen/io/lammps`:\n\n- Enhanced security by removing `exec` usage to mitigate risks from untrusted sources.\n- Standardized file operations with `encoding=\"utf-8\"` for consistency.\n- Improved dictionary operations by switching to direct assignment.\n- Enhanced default value handling for specific scenarios.\n- Clarified code for better readability and maintenance.\n- Optimized methods for improved efficiency and error handling.\n\nThese modifications collectively aim to fortify security, efficiency, and maintainability in the `pymatgen` library's LAMMPS data processing support.\n\n-->\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: short summary by coderabbit.ai --><!-- commit_ids_reviewed_start -->\n\n<!-- febea7894c8565c22a1bf948b6ba3d570e6c6f6e -->\n<!-- 0be94350a16df060162d0d43c088b3a36ee0b4b0 -->\n<!-- ebd1184d10421ba2f5e4d7011d371f0b9613c54a -->\n\n<!-- commit_ids_reviewed_end --><!-- tweet_start -->\n\nThank you for using CodeRabbit.

Example:\n\t- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`\n\t- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n\t- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n\t- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n\t-\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n\t- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`\n\t- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`\n\t- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n\t- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/coderabbit-overrides.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://coderabbit.ai/docs) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](https://discord.com/invite/GsXnASn26c) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->",

Instead, safer alternatives are employed to achieve the same functionality without compromising security. This PR encompasses modifications across several files within the project, specifically targeting areas where `eval` was previously used and replacing it with `literal_eval` or other safer methods. Additionally, the PR introduces minor formatting tweaks to improve the readability and consistency of the code. These changes span across multiple modules, including `pymatgen/analysis/magnetism/heisenberg.py`, `pymatgen/electronic_structure/boltztrap2.py`, and `pymatgen/io/vasp/inputs.py`, indicating a broad and impactful set of improvements aimed at enhancing the code's overall quality and security posture.\n\n### AI-generated Summary of Generated Summaries\n\nThe Pull Request introduces several key changes across different modules to improve security, readability, and efficiency. Notably, the unsafe `eval` function has been replaced with `literal_eval` in the `from_dict` class method within `pymatgen/analysis/magnetism/heisenberg.py`, directly addressing the primary objective of enhancing security. This module also sees adjustments in loop logic, condition simplifications, and the optimization of tolerance value handling and duplicate removals, contributing to cleaner and more efficient code.\n\nIn `pymatgen/electronic_structure/boltztrap2.py`, the changes focus on refining the logic related to spin polarization and structural assignments, alongside methodological refinements in property access and calculation processes. These modifications streamline the handling of spin-polarized calculations and improve the clarity and performance of property plotting and band analysis methods.\n\nThe `pymatgen/io/vasp/inputs.py` module experiences enhancements in parameter type checking, utilizing the walrus operator for more concise assignment operations, and the removal of unnecessary integer value handling for hashing. Additionally, the documentation for the `__iter__` method in the `Potcar` class has been clarified, aiding in better understanding and usage of the method.\n\nCollectively, these changes across the three modules not only address the critical security concerns associated with the use of `eval` but also introduce several optimizations and clarifications that contribute to the overall maintainability, readability, and efficiency of the codebase. The PR effectively moves the project away from potentially hazardous practices while streamlining various aspects of the code, demonstrating a comprehensive approach to improving the project's quality and security.\n\n-->\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: short summary by coderabbit.ai --><!-- commit_ids_reviewed_start -->\n\n<!-- 5ca3aff1b81589ca37b03279f1cf6a3f716a4085 -->\n\n<!-- commit_ids_reviewed_end --><!-- tweet_start -->\n\nThank you for using CodeRabbit.

Changes include adopting Unicode encoding, refining dictionary operations, ensuring default values, enhancing assignments for clarity, and optimizing file processing for efficiency.\n\n## Changes\n\n| Files | Summary |\n|-------|---------|\n| `pymatgen/io/lammps/data.py`, `pymatgen/io/lammps/inputs.py` | - Added `encoding=\"utf-8\"` in file operations.<br>- Simplified dictionary updates.<br>- Managed default values for specific data fields.<br>- Clarified variable assignments for improved readability.<br>- Optimized file parsing and error handling. |\n| `pymatgen/io/lammps/outputs.py` | - Updated file sorting based on a pattern.<br>- Adjusted regular expression handling for file access. |\n\n> 🐇✨  \n> To the code we hop and leap,  \n> Through the files, our changes seep.  \n> With each line, we aim to enhance,  \n> Unicode and syntax dance.  \n> A rabbit's touch, so light and deft,  \n> Leaves the codebase improved and left.  \n> 🌟📄🚀\n\n<!-- walkthrough_end --><!-- This is an auto-generated comment: raw summary by coderabbit.ai -->\n<!--\n\n\npymatgen/io/lammps/data.py: ## Short summary\n\n- Added `encoding=\"utf-8\"` parameter in `open` function calls.\n- Changed dictionary update syntax from `body.update({name: section})` to `body[name] = section`.\n- Modified the handling of `topo.charges` to use a default value if `topo.charges` is empty.\n- Updated assignment of `self.force_field` to use `ff_dfs or None` for clarity.\n- Revised the `from_files` method to handle file parsing and clustering more efficiently.\n- Improved error handling for different atom styles in files.\n- Updated type annotations in `from_files` method parameters.\n\npymatgen/io/lammps/inputs.py: ### Short Summary\n\n- In the `ncomments` method, the variable `_args` is used instead of `args` in the list comprehension.\n- In the `merge_stages` method, the condition is changed to check if any stage is not in `self.stages_names` instead of all stages.\n- In the `from_str` method, the construction of the `header` variable is optimized using a list comprehension.\n- In the `_add_comment` method, the condition for inline comments is simplified.\n- In the `md` method, the file is opened with explicit encoding specified.\n- In the `write_lammps_inputs` method, the assignment of `data_filename` is updated using the walrus operator.\n\npymatgen/io/lammps/outputs.py: ### Short Summary\n\nIn the `pymatgen/io/lammps/outputs.py` file, the changes involve modifying how files are sorted based on a pattern and accessing matched groups in regular expressions. Specifically, the sorting of files based on a key function and accessing matched groups in regular expressions have been adjusted to simplify the code logic.\n\n-->\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: raw summary by coderabbit.ai --><!-- This is an auto-generated comment: short summary by coderabbit.ai -->\n<!--\n\n\n### PR Objectives\n\nPR #3736 aims to bolster security and code quality in the `pymatgen` library by eliminating the use of `exec`, particularly from untrusted sources like external filenames, to mitigate security risks such as the `xz` backdoor. Additionally, minor enhancements suggested by `sourcery` are applied to refine the codebase.\n\n### Comments Summary\n\n- Request for review by `DanielYang59` directed to `@janosh`.\n- Code changes in `pymatgen/io/lammps/data.py`, `pymatgen/io/lammps/inputs.py`, and `pymatgen/io/lammps/outputs.py` include:\n  - Standardizing file operations with `encoding=\"utf-8\"`.\n  - Refactoring dictionary updates for clarity.\n  - Improving default value handling for specific cases.\n  - Enhancing code readability and error handling.\n  - Optimizing methods for efficiency and error prevention.\n\n### AI-generated Summary of Generated Summaries\n\nKey changes in PR #3736 for `pymatgen/io/lammps`:\n\n- Enhanced security by removing `exec` usage to mitigate risks from untrusted sources.\n- Standardized file operations with `encoding=\"utf-8\"` for consistency.\n- Improved dictionary operations by switching to direct assignment.\n- Enhanced default value handling for specific scenarios.\n- Clarified code for better readability and maintenance.\n- Optimized methods for improved efficiency and error handling.\n\nThese modifications collectively aim to fortify security, efficiency, and maintainability in the `pymatgen` library's LAMMPS data processing support.\n\n-->\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: short summary by coderabbit.ai --><!-- commit_ids_reviewed_start -->\n\n<!-- febea7894c8565c22a1bf948b6ba3d570e6c6f6e -->\n<!-- 0be94350a16df060162d0d43c088b3a36ee0b4b0 -->\n<!-- ebd1184d10421ba2f5e4d7011d371f0b9613c54a -->\n\n<!-- commit_ids_reviewed_end --><!-- tweet_start -->\n\nThank you for using CodeRabbit.

Example:\n\t- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`\n\t- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n\t- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n\t- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n\t-\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n\t- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`\n\t- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`\n\t- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n\t- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n\nAdditionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/coderabbit-overrides.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://coderabbit.ai/docs) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](https://discord.com/invite/GsXnASn26c) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->",

Like all\n  Litestar projects, this application is open to contributions, big and small.\n</details>\n\n## Sponsors\n\nLitestar is an open-source project, and we enjoy the support of our sponsors to help fund the exciting\nwork we do.\n\nA **huge** thanks to our sponsors:\n\n[//]: # \"Note to maintainers: Highest sponsors first; no more than 3 per row - create new div if needed\"\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/scalar/scalar/?utm_source=litestar&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=main-badge\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Scalar.com - Document, Discover and Test APIs with Scalar.\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litestar-org/branding/main/assets/sponsors/scalar.svg\" width=\"180\" alt=\"Scalar.com\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://telemetrysports.com/\" title=\"Telemetry Sports - Changing the way data influences the sports experience\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/litestar-org/branding/main/assets/sponsors/telemetry-sports/unofficial-telemetry-whitebg.svg\" width=\"150\" alt=\"Telemetry Sports\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://www.stok.kr/\" title=\"Stok - Stack Up Your Assets!\"><img src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/144093421?s=400&v=4\" width=\"150\" alt=\"Stok\"></a>\n\n<a href=\"https://docs.litestar.dev/dev/#sponsors\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">Check out our sponsors in the docs</a>\n\nIf you would like to support the work that we do please consider [becoming a sponsor][sponsor-polar]\nvia [Polar.sh][sponsor-polar] (preferred), [GitHub][sponsor-github] or [Open Collective][sponsor-oc].\n\nAlso, exclusively with [Polar][sponsor-polar], you can engage in pledge-based sponsorships.\n\n[sponsor-github]: https://github.com/sponsors/litestar-org\n[sponsor-oc]: https://opencollective.com/litestar\n[sponsor-polar]: https://polar.sh/litestar-org\n\n## Features\n\n### Class-based Controllers\n\nWhile supporting function-based route handlers, Litestar also supports and promotes python OOP using class based\ncontrollers:\n\n<details>\n<summary>Example for class-based controllers</summary>\n\n```python title=\"my_app/controllers/user.py\"\nfrom typing import List, Optional\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\nfrom litestar import Controller, get, post, put, patch, delete\nfrom litestar.dto import DTOData\nfrom pydantic import UUID4\n\nfrom my_app.models import User, PartialUserDTO\n\n\nclass UserController(Controller):\n    path = \"/users\"\n\n    @post()\n    async def create_user(self, data: User) -> User: ...\n\n    @get()\n    async def list_users(self) -> List[User]: ...\n\n    @get(path=\"/{date:int}\")\n    async def list_new_users(self, date: datetime) -> List[User]: ...\n\n    @patch(path=\"/{user_id:uuid}\", dto=PartialUserDTO)\n    async def partial_update_user(\n        self, user_id: UUID4, data: DTOData[PartialUserDTO]\n    ) -> User: ...\n\n    @put(path=\"/{user_id:uuid}\")\n    async def update_user(self, user_id: UUID4, data: User) -> User: ...\n\n    @get(path=\"/{user_name:str}\")\n    async def get_user_by_name(self, user_name: str) -> Optional[User]: ...\n\n    @get(path=\"/{user_id:uuid}\")\n    async def get_user(self, user_id: UUID4) -> User: ...\n\n    @delete(path=\"/{user_id:uuid}\")\n    async def delete_user(self, user_id: UUID4) -> None: ...\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Data Parsing, Type Hints, and Msgspec\n\nLitestar is rigorously typed, and it enforces typing. For example, if you forget to type a return value for a route\nhandler, an exception will be raised. The reason for this is that Litestar uses typing data to generate OpenAPI specs,\nas well as to validate and parse data. Thus, typing is essential to the framework.\n\nFurthermore, Litestar allows extending its support using plugins.\n\n### Plugin System, ORM support, and DTOs\n\nLitestar has a plugin system that allows the user to extend serialization/deserialization, OpenAPI generation, and other\nfeatures.\n\nIt ships with a builtin plugin for SQL Alchemy, which allows the user to use SQLAlchemy declarative classes \"natively\"\ni.e., as type parameters that will be serialized/deserialized and to return them as values from route\nhandlers.\n\nLitestar also supports the programmatic creation of DTOs with a `DTOFactory` class, which also supports the use of\nplugins.\n\n### OpenAPI\n\nLitestar has custom logic to generate OpenAPI 3.1.0 schema, include optional generation of examples using the\n[`polyfactory`](https://pypi.org/project/polyfactory/) library.\n\n#### ReDoc, Swagger-UI and Stoplight Elements API Documentation\n\nLitestar serves the documentation from the generated OpenAPI schema with:\n\n- [ReDoc](https://redoc.ly/)\n- [Swagger-UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/)\n- [Stoplight Elements](https://github.com/stoplightio/elements)\n- [RapiDoc](https://rapidocweb.com/)\n\nAll these are available and enabled by default.\n\n### Dependency Injection\n\nLitestar has a simple but powerful DI system inspired by pytest. You can define named dependencies - sync or async - at\ndifferent levels of the application, and then selective use or overwrite them.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Example for DI</summary>\n\n```python\nfrom litestar import Litestar, get\nfrom litestar.di import Provide\n\n\nasync def my_dependency() -> str: ...\n\n\n@get(\"/\")\nasync def index(injected: str) -> str:\n    return injected\n\n\napp = Litestar([index], dependencies={\"injected\": Provide(my_dependency)})\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Middleware\n\nLitestar supports typical ASGI middleware and ships with middlewares to handle things such as\n\n- CORS\n- CSRF\n- Rate limiting\n- GZip and Brotli compression\n- Client- and server-side sessions\n\n### Route Guards\n\nLitestar has an authorization mechanism called `guards`, which allows the user to define guard functions at different\nlevel of the application (app, router, controller etc.) and validate the request before hitting the route handler\nfunction.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Example for route guards</summary>\n\n```python\nfrom litestar import Litestar, get\n\nfrom litestar.connection import ASGIConnection\nfrom litestar.handlers.base import BaseRouteHandler\nfrom litestar.exceptions import NotAuthorizedException\n\n\nasync def is_authorized(connection: ASGIConnection, handler: BaseRouteHandler) -> None:\n    # validate authorization\n    # if not authorized, raise NotAuthorizedException\n    raise NotAuthorizedException()\n\n\n@get(\"/\", guards=[is_authorized])\nasync def index() -> None: ...\n\n\napp = Litestar([index])\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Request Life Cycle Hooks\n\nLitestar supports request life cycle hooks, similarly to Flask - i.e. `before_request` and `after_request`\n\n## Performance\n\nLitestar is fast. It is on par with, or significantly faster than comparable ASGI frameworks.\n\nYou can see and run the benchmarks [here](https://github.com/litestar-org/api-performance-tests),\nor read more about it [here](https://docs.litestar.dev/latest/benchmarks) in our documentation.\n\n## Contributing\n\nLitestar is open to contributions big and small.

Here's the code in question: https://github.com/litestar-org/litestar/blob/f7b258f97592626934b4224e52c030983c9bf41b/litestar/security/base.py#L90-L95\r\n\r\nWhere `app_config.openapi_config.components` has a type of `Components | list[Components]` https://github.com/litestar-org/litestar/blob/f7b258f97592626934b4224e52c030983c9bf41b/litestar/openapi/config.py#L91 `Components` can never be false (it does not have `__bool__` or `__len__` defined).\r\n\r\nSo, mypy raises an error for this case. We either have:\r\n- Missing `None` annotation for `components` and a missing test case ?\r\n- Extra `else` branch in this `if` ?",

Using just one client might not be feasible due to cookies that server could set (should be different for the two users) and in general it would be nice to have the two separated.\r\n\r\n```py\r\nclient = TestClient(app=app)\r\nclient.get(..., auth=user1_auth)  # requires also...\r\nclient.get(..., auth=user2_auth)  # ...this repetition\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Basic Example\r\n\r\nMaybe something like:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nwith create_portal(app) as portal:\r\n    user1 = TestClient(portal=portal, auth=...)\r\n    user2 = TestClient(portal=portal, auth=...)\r\n    user1.get(...)\r\n    user2.get(...)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Drawbacks and Impact\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Unresolved questions\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n<!-- POLAR PLEDGE BADGE START -->\r\n---\r\n> [!NOTE]  \r\n> While we are open for sponsoring on [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/litestar-org/) and \r\n> [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/litestar), we also utilize [Polar.sh](https://polar.sh/) to engage in pledge-based sponsorship.\r\n>\r\n> Check out all issues funded or available for funding [on our Polar.sh dashboard](https://polar.sh/litestar-org)\r\n> * If you would like to see an issue prioritized, make a pledge towards it!\r\n> * We receive the pledge once the issue is completed & verified\r\n> * This, along with engagement in the community, helps us know which features are a priority to our users.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://polar.sh/litestar-org/litestar/issues/2992\">\r\n<picture>\r\n  <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://polar.sh/api/github/litestar-org/litestar/issues/2992/pledge.svg?darkmode=1\">\r\n  <img alt=\"Fund with Polar\" src=\"https://polar.sh/api/github/litestar-org/litestar/issues/2992/pledge.svg\">\r\n</picture>\r\n</a>\r\n<!-- POLAR PLEDGE BADGE END -->\r\n",

There's not much we can do here.\r\n\r\nThat being said, Auth0 has an [SDK for Python](https://auth0-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), that you should be able to easily integrate into your Litestar application. You'd simply have to replace the authlib API shown in your example with the equivalent Auth0 SDK functionality :)\r\n",

Looking at the documentation, it should return some value or `None`, and using one or both of those as a return type is successful. The API itself runs just fine with an invalid return type, and this only seems to affect the schema routes.\r\n\r\nIt seems like maybe this is expected behavior so that you are forced to set a proper return type, but maybe a more extensive error message pointing to the location of the issue could be added? The current error I get is `litestar.exceptions.http_exceptions.ImproperlyConfiguredException: 500: Unable to serialize response content`, which took a while to figure out what caused it.\n\n### URL to code causing the issue\n\nhttps://github.com/rseeley/litestar-before-request-error-mvce/blob/main/app.py\n\n### MCVE\n\n_No response_\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n```bash\n1.

Since the hook returns an `ASGIResponse` if you don't return anything, and we default to encode with JSON, Litestar will then attempt to encode the `ASGIResponse` as JSON.\r\n\r\nI'm not entirely sure *why* we alter the return type like this, @peterschutt do you have any insight there? I removed the code in question and it didn't seem to break anything, so I'm not even sure this is actually intentional.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I don't think we *should* be doing this, since it's extremely unexpected and I can't think of a good reason why this would be the desired behaviour. The return type of the handler should be the source of truth in any case, and it's the user's responsibility to return an appropriate type from any hooks that might be in the pipeline.",

I think we should make it configurable somehow, though I'm not sure how easy that would be to implement. This way, the user should be able to specify whether to apply the guards for the automatically created `OPTIONS` handler as well as a way to specify the same for manually created `OPTIONS` handler as well.",

E.g.,:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nclass Market(Base):\r\n    prices = relationship(\"Price\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead of something like:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nclass Market(Base):\r\n    prices: Mapped[list[Price]] = relationship()\r\n```\r\n\r\nSpeculation on my part though, so I'll wait to hear from you before going any further.\r\n\r\nCheers.",

E.g.,:\r\n\r\n```py\r\ndef returns_list() -> Sequence[int]:\r\n    return [1, 2, 3]\r\n\r\nl = returns_list()\r\nl.append(4)  # mypy will complain because it thinks `l` is a generic sequence which has no `append()` method\r\n\r\n# so user needs to do this\r\nl = list(returns_list())\r\nl.append(4)\r\n```\r\nThis example is essentially what the service object is does in that repo. It knows that `self.repository.list()` returns a `list`, but annotates the return of its own `list()` method as `Sequence`, which loses info for downstream users.\r\n",

A redirect to another (external) URL ([`Redirect`])\r\n\r\nI'm struggling on how to implement this and not sure whether I'm running into a documentation issue where it's just not clear, or an actual

close to a working solution that meets both goals, but it doesn't _quite_ get me where I want.\r\nFor clarity, I'll iterate over all possible approaches I've attempted so far.\r\n\r\n### Template response\r\n\r\nPoint (1) can be achieved with simple [`Template`] response, which looks as

That is, a function signature like `def hello(name: str = \"world\") -> Template | Redirect:`\r\n\r\n(Or for older Python versions, `def hello(name: str = \"world\") -> typing.Union[Template, Redirect]:`)\r\n\r\nI'm also quite happy just returning `Response`, but then I would like a way to get access to the templating engine myself, so that it's possible to do something along the lines of (pseudo-code):\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\n@get(\"/{name:str}\", include_in_schema=False)\r\ndef hello(name: str = \"world\", templater: TemplateEngine) -> Response:\r\n        response_content = templater.get_template(\"hello.html.j2\").render(context={\"name\": name})\r\n\r\n        return Response(\r\n            content=response_content,\r\n            media_type=\"text/html\",\r\n        )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis _might_ already be possible and I just don't know how to get the TemplateEngine injected. If so, I'd love to be pointed at how this could be achieved, and I'll happily make a PR to at least document this better.\r\n\r\n## Miscellaneous notes\r\n\r\nWhile I'm talking only about Template and Redirect here as that is the use-case I'm trying to solve, I imagine the same issues likely exist around mixing in [`StreamingResponse`] and [`FileResponse`].\r\n\r\n[`Template`]: https://docs.starliteproject.dev/latest/reference/datastructures/response_containers.html#starlite.datastructures.response_containers.Template\r\n[`Redirect`]: https://docs.starliteproject.dev/latest/reference/datastructures/response_containers.html#starlite.datastructures.response_containers.Redirect\r\n[`StreamingResponse`]: https://docs.starliteproject.dev/latest/reference/response.html#starlite.response.StreamingResponse\r\n[`FileResponse`]: https://docs.starliteproject.dev/latest/reference/response.html#starlite.response.FileResponse\r\n",

Because it does not accept a `status_code`, you cannot simply return it. If this were the case, you could do:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@get(\"/{name:str}\", include_in_schema=False)\r\ndef hello(name: str) -> ResponseContainer:\r\n    if name == \"foo\":\r\n        return Redirect(path=f\"http://example.com/{name}\", status_code=HTTP_307_TEMPORARY_REDIRECT)\r\n\r\n    return Template(name=\"hello.html.j2\", context={\"name\": name})\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is quite a lot nicer.\r\n\r\nI'll open an issue to support this, although it will most likely end up in 2.0.\r\n\r\n<hr> \r\n\r\nFrom a documentation perspective, we should definitely have a section about returning optional redirect like that.",

Here's the code in question: https://github.com/litestar-org/litestar/blob/f7b258f97592626934b4224e52c030983c9bf41b/litestar/security/base.py#L90-L95\r\n\r\nWhere `app_config.openapi_config.components` has a type of `Components | list[Components]` https://github.com/litestar-org/litestar/blob/f7b258f97592626934b4224e52c030983c9bf41b/litestar/openapi/config.py#L91 `Components` can never be false (it does not have `__bool__` or `__len__` defined).\r\n\r\nSo, mypy raises an error for this case. We either have:\r\n- Missing `None` annotation for `components` and a missing test case ?\r\n- Extra `else` branch in this `if` ?",

Using just one client might not be feasible due to cookies that server could set (should be different for the two users) and in general it would be nice to have the two separated.\r\n\r\n```py\r\nclient = TestClient(app=app)\r\nclient.get(..., auth=user1_auth)  # requires also...\r\nclient.get(..., auth=user2_auth)  # ...this repetition\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Basic Example\r\n\r\nMaybe something like:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nwith create_portal(app) as portal:\r\n    user1 = TestClient(portal=portal, auth=...)\r\n    user2 = TestClient(portal=portal, auth=...)\r\n    user1.get(...)\r\n    user2.get(...)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Drawbacks and Impact\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Unresolved questions\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n<!-- POLAR PLEDGE BADGE START -->\r\n---\r\n> [!NOTE]  \r\n> While we are open for sponsoring on [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/litestar-org/) and \r\n> [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/litestar), we also utilize [Polar.sh](https://polar.sh/) to engage in pledge-based sponsorship.\r\n>\r\n> Check out all issues funded or available for funding [on our Polar.sh dashboard](https://polar.sh/litestar-org)\r\n> * If you would like to see an issue prioritized, make a pledge towards it!\r\n> * We receive the pledge once the issue is completed & verified\r\n> * This, along with engagement in the community, helps us know which features are a priority to our users.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://polar.sh/litestar-org/litestar/issues/2992\">\r\n<picture>\r\n  <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://polar.sh/api/github/litestar-org/litestar/issues/2992/pledge.svg?darkmode=1\">\r\n  <img alt=\"Fund with Polar\" src=\"https://polar.sh/api/github/litestar-org/litestar/issues/2992/pledge.svg\">\r\n</picture>\r\n</a>\r\n<!-- POLAR PLEDGE BADGE END -->\r\n",

There's not much we can do here.\r\n\r\nThat being said, Auth0 has an [SDK for Python](https://auth0-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), that you should be able to easily integrate into your Litestar application. You'd simply have to replace the authlib API shown in your example with the equivalent Auth0 SDK functionality :)\r\n",

Looking at the documentation, it should return some value or `None`, and using one or both of those as a return type is successful. The API itself runs just fine with an invalid return type, and this only seems to affect the schema routes.\r\n\r\nIt seems like maybe this is expected behavior so that you are forced to set a proper return type, but maybe a more extensive error message pointing to the location of the issue could be added? The current error I get is `litestar.exceptions.http_exceptions.ImproperlyConfiguredException: 500: Unable to serialize response content`, which took a while to figure out what caused it.\n\n### URL to code causing the issue\n\nhttps://github.com/rseeley/litestar-before-request-error-mvce/blob/main/app.py\n\n### MCVE\n\n_No response_\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n```bash\n1.

Since the hook returns an `ASGIResponse` if you don't return anything, and we default to encode with JSON, Litestar will then attempt to encode the `ASGIResponse` as JSON.\r\n\r\nI'm not entirely sure *why* we alter the return type like this, @peterschutt do you have any insight there? I removed the code in question and it didn't seem to break anything, so I'm not even sure this is actually intentional.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I don't think we *should* be doing this, since it's extremely unexpected and I can't think of a good reason why this would be the desired behaviour. The return type of the handler should be the source of truth in any case, and it's the user's responsibility to return an appropriate type from any hooks that might be in the pipeline.",

I think we should make it configurable somehow, though I'm not sure how easy that would be to implement. This way, the user should be able to specify whether to apply the guards for the automatically created `OPTIONS` handler as well as a way to specify the same for manually created `OPTIONS` handler as well.",

E.g.,:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nclass Market(Base):\r\n    prices = relationship(\"Price\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead of something like:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nclass Market(Base):\r\n    prices: Mapped[list[Price]] = relationship()\r\n```\r\n\r\nSpeculation on my part though, so I'll wait to hear from you before going any further.\r\n\r\nCheers.",

E.g.,:\r\n\r\n```py\r\ndef returns_list() -> Sequence[int]:\r\n    return [1, 2, 3]\r\n\r\nl = returns_list()\r\nl.append(4)  # mypy will complain because it thinks `l` is a generic sequence which has no `append()` method\r\n\r\n# so user needs to do this\r\nl = list(returns_list())\r\nl.append(4)\r\n```\r\nThis example is essentially what the service object is does in that repo. It knows that `self.repository.list()` returns a `list`, but annotates the return of its own `list()` method as `Sequence`, which loses info for downstream users.\r\n",

A redirect to another (external) URL ([`Redirect`])\r\n\r\nI'm struggling on how to implement this and not sure whether I'm running into a documentation issue where it's just not clear, or an actual

close to a working solution that meets both goals, but it doesn't _quite_ get me where I want.\r\nFor clarity, I'll iterate over all possible approaches I've attempted so far.\r\n\r\n### Template response\r\n\r\nPoint (1) can be achieved with simple [`Template`] response, which looks as

That is, a function signature like `def hello(name: str = \"world\") -> Template | Redirect:`\r\n\r\n(Or for older Python versions, `def hello(name: str = \"world\") -> typing.Union[Template, Redirect]:`)\r\n\r\nI'm also quite happy just returning `Response`, but then I would like a way to get access to the templating engine myself, so that it's possible to do something along the lines of (pseudo-code):\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\n@get(\"/{name:str}\", include_in_schema=False)\r\ndef hello(name: str = \"world\", templater: TemplateEngine) -> Response:\r\n        response_content = templater.get_template(\"hello.html.j2\").render(context={\"name\": name})\r\n\r\n        return Response(\r\n            content=response_content,\r\n            media_type=\"text/html\",\r\n        )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis _might_ already be possible and I just don't know how to get the TemplateEngine injected. If so, I'd love to be pointed at how this could be achieved, and I'll happily make a PR to at least document this better.\r\n\r\n## Miscellaneous notes\r\n\r\nWhile I'm talking only about Template and Redirect here as that is the use-case I'm trying to solve, I imagine the same issues likely exist around mixing in [`StreamingResponse`] and [`FileResponse`].\r\n\r\n[`Template`]: https://docs.starliteproject.dev/latest/reference/datastructures/response_containers.html#starlite.datastructures.response_containers.Template\r\n[`Redirect`]: https://docs.starliteproject.dev/latest/reference/datastructures/response_containers.html#starlite.datastructures.response_containers.Redirect\r\n[`StreamingResponse`]: https://docs.starliteproject.dev/latest/reference/response.html#starlite.response.StreamingResponse\r\n[`FileResponse`]: https://docs.starliteproject.dev/latest/reference/response.html#starlite.response.FileResponse\r\n",

Because it does not accept a `status_code`, you cannot simply return it. If this were the case, you could do:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@get(\"/{name:str}\", include_in_schema=False)\r\ndef hello(name: str) -> ResponseContainer:\r\n    if name == \"foo\":\r\n        return Redirect(path=f\"http://example.com/{name}\", status_code=HTTP_307_TEMPORARY_REDIRECT)\r\n\r\n    return Template(name=\"hello.html.j2\", context={\"name\": name})\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is quite a lot nicer.\r\n\r\nI'll open an issue to support this, although it will most likely end up in 2.0.\r\n\r\n<hr> \r\n\r\nFrom a documentation perspective, we should definitely have a section about returning optional redirect like that.",

This was my first foray into using Starlite so I the side effects of `__future__.annotations` weren't clear. Maybe worth a note in the documentation that `__future__.annotations` can cause issues, but it doesn't sound like back porting a fix is that worth it.",

DOMPurify was [started in February 2014](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/commit/a630922616927373485e0e787ab19e73e3691b2b) and, meanwhile, has reached version **v3.1.7**.\n\nDOMPurify is written in JavaScript and works in all modern browsers (Safari (10+), Opera (15+), Edge, Firefox and Chrome - as well as almost anything else using Blink, Gecko or WebKit). It doesn't break on MSIE or other legacy browsers. It simply does nothing.\n\n**Note that [DOMPurify v2.5.7](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/releases/tag/2.5.7) is the latest version supporting MSIE. For important security updates compatible with MSIE, please use the [2.x branch](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/tree/2.x).**\n\nOur automated tests cover [19 different browsers](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/blob/main/test/karma.custom-launchers.config.js#L5) right now, more to come. We also cover Node.js v16.x, v17.x, v18.x and v19.x, running DOMPurify on [jsdom](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom). Older Node versions are known to work as well, but hey... no guarantees.\n\nDOMPurify is written by security people who have vast background in web attacks and XSS. Fear not. For more details please also read about our [Security Goals & Threat Model](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/wiki/Security-Goals-&-Threat-Model). Please, read it. Like, really.\n\n## What does it do?\n\nDOMPurify sanitizes HTML and prevents XSS attacks. You can feed DOMPurify with string full of dirty HTML and it will return a string (unless configured otherwise) with clean HTML. DOMPurify will strip out everything that contains dangerous HTML and thereby prevent XSS attacks and other nastiness. It's also damn bloody fast. We use the technologies the browser provides and turn them into an XSS filter. The faster your browser, the faster DOMPurify will be.\n\n## How do I use it?\n\nIt's easy. Just include DOMPurify on your website.\n\n### Using the unminified development version\n\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"src/purify.js\"></script>\n```\n\n### Using the minified and tested production version (source-map available)\n\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"dist/purify.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nAfterwards you can sanitize strings by executing the following code:\n\n```js\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty);\n```\n\nOr maybe this, if you love working with Angular or alike:\n\n```js\nimport DOMPurify from 'dompurify';\n\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize('<b>hello there</b>');\n```\n\nThe resulting HTML can be written into a DOM element using `innerHTML` or the DOM using `document.write()`. That is fully up to you.\nNote that by default, we permit HTML, SVG **and** MathML. If you only need HTML, which might be a very common use-case, you can easily set that up as well:\n\n```js\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, { USE_PROFILES: { html: true } });\n```\n\n### Is there any foot-gun potential?\n\nWell, please note, if you _first_ sanitize HTML and then modify it _afterwards_, you might easily **void the effects of sanitization**. If you feed the sanitized markup to another library _after_ sanitization, please be certain that the library doesn't mess around with the HTML on its own.\n\n### Okay, makes sense, let's move on\n\nAfter sanitizing your markup, you can also have a look at the property `DOMPurify.removed` and find out, what elements and attributes were thrown out. Please **do not use** this property for making any security critical decisions. This is just a little helper for curious minds.\n\n### Running DOMPurify on the server\n\nDOMPurify technically also works server-side with Node.js. Our support strives to follow the [Node.js release cycle](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/).\n\nRunning DOMPurify on the server requires a DOM to be present, which is probably no surprise. Usually, [jsdom](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom) is the tool of choice and we **strongly recommend** to use the latest version of _jsdom_.\n\nWhy? Because older versions of _jsdom_ are known to be buggy in ways that result in XSS _even if_ DOMPurify does everything 100% correctly. There are **known attack vectors** in, e.g. _jsdom v19.0.0_ that are fixed in _jsdom v20.0.0_ - and we really recommend to keep _jsdom_ up to date because of that.\n\nPlease also be aware that tools like [happy-dom](https://github.com/capricorn86/happy-dom) exist but **are not considered safe** at this point. Combining DOMPurify with _happy-dom_ is currently not recommended and will likely lead to XSS.\n\nOther than that, you are fine to use DOMPurify on the server. Probably. This really depends on _jsdom_ or whatever DOM you utilize server-side. If you can live with that, this is how you get it to work:\n\n```bash\nnpm install dompurify\nnpm install jsdom\n```\n\nFor _jsdom_ (please use an up-to-date version), this should do the trick:\n\n```js\nconst createDOMPurify = require('dompurify');\nconst { JSDOM } = require('jsdom');\n\nconst window = new JSDOM('').window;\nconst DOMPurify = createDOMPurify(window);\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize('<b>hello there</b>');\n```\n\nOr even this, if you prefer working with imports:\n\n```js\nimport { JSDOM } from 'jsdom';\nimport DOMPurify from 'dompurify';\n\nconst window = new JSDOM('').window;\nconst purify = DOMPurify(window);\nconst clean = purify.sanitize('<b>hello there</b>');\n```\n\nIf you have problems making it work in your specific setup, consider looking at the amazing [isomorphic-dompurify](https://github.com/kkomelin/isomorphic-dompurify) project which solves lots of problems people might run into.\n\n```bash\nnpm install isomorphic-dompurify\n```\n\n```js\nimport DOMPurify from 'isomorphic-dompurify';\n\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize('<s>hello</s>');\n```\n\n## Is there a demo?\n\nOf course there is a demo! [Play with DOMPurify](https://cure53.de/purify)\n\n## What if I find a _security_ bug?\n\nFirst of all, please immediately contact us via [email](mailto:mario@cure53.de) so we can work on a fix. [PGP key](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0xC26C858090F70ADA)\n\nAlso, you probably qualify for a bug bounty! The fine folks over at [Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com/) use DOMPurify for their services and added our library to their bug bounty scope. So, if you find a way to bypass or weaken DOMPurify, please also have a look at their website and the [bug bounty info](https://www.fastmail.com/about/bugbounty/).\n\n## Some purification samples please?\n\nHow does purified markup look like? Well, [the demo](https://cure53.de/purify) shows it for a big bunch of nasty elements. But let's also show some smaller examples!\n\n```js\nDOMPurify.sanitize('<img src=x onerror=alert(1)//>'); // becomes <img src=\"x\">\nDOMPurify.sanitize('<svg><g/onload=alert(2)//<p>'); // becomes <svg><g></g></svg>\nDOMPurify.sanitize('<p>abc<iframe//src=jAva&Tab;script:alert(3)>def</p>'); // becomes <p>abc</p>\nDOMPurify.sanitize('<math><mi//xlink:href=\"data:x,<script>alert(4)</script>\">'); // becomes <math><mi></mi></math>\nDOMPurify.sanitize('<TABLE><tr><td>HELLO</tr></TABL>'); // becomes <table><tbody><tr><td>HELLO</td></tr></tbody></table>\nDOMPurify.sanitize('<UL><li><A HREF=//google.com>click</UL>'); // becomes <ul><li><a href=\"//google.com\">click</a></li></ul>\n```\n\n## What is supported?\n\nDOMPurify currently supports HTML5, SVG and MathML. DOMPurify per default allows CSS, HTML custom data attributes. DOMPurify also supports the Shadow DOM - and sanitizes DOM templates recursively. DOMPurify also allows you to sanitize HTML for being used with the jQuery `$()` and `elm.html()` API without any known problems.\n\n## What about legacy browsers like Internet Explorer?\n\nDOMPurify does nothing at all. It simply returns exactly the string that you fed it. DOMPurify exposes a property called `isSupported`, which tells you whether it will be able to do its job, so you can come up with your own backup plan.\n\n## What about DOMPurify and Trusted Types?\n\nIn version 1.0.9, support for [Trusted Types API](https://github.com/w3c/webappsec-trusted-types) was added to DOMPurify.\nIn version 2.0.0, a config flag was added to control DOMPurify's behavior regarding this.\n\nWhen `DOMPurify.sanitize` is used in an environment where the Trusted Types API is available and `RETURN_TRUSTED_TYPE` is set to `true`, it tries to return a `TrustedHTML` value instead of a string (the behavior for `RETURN_DOM` and `RETURN_DOM_FRAGMENT` config options does not change).\n\nNote that in order to create a policy in `trustedTypes` using DOMPurify, `RETURN_TRUSTED_TYPE: false` is required, as `createHTML` expects a normal string, not `TrustedHTML`. The example below shows this.\n\n```js\nwindow.trustedTypes!.createPolicy('default', {\n  createHTML: (to_escape) =>\n    DOMPurify.sanitize(to_escape, { RETURN_TRUSTED_TYPE: false }),\n});\n```\n\n## Can I configure DOMPurify?\n\nYes. The included default configuration values are pretty good already - but you can of course override them. Check out the [`/demos`](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/tree/main/demos) folder to see a bunch of examples on how you can [customize DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/tree/main/demos#what-is-this).\n\n### General settings\n```js\n// strip {{ ... }}, ${ ... } and <% ... %> to make output safe for template systems\n// be careful please, this mode is not recommended for production usage.\n// allowing template parsing in user-controlled HTML is not advised at all.\n// only use this mode if there is really no alternative.\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {SAFE_FOR_TEMPLATES: true});\n\n\n// change how e.g. comments containing risky HTML characters are treated.\n// be very careful, this setting should only be set to `false` if you really only handle \n// HTML and nothing else, no SVG, MathML or the like. \n// Otherwise, changing from `true` to `false` will lead to XSS in this or some other way.\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {SAFE_FOR_XML: false});\n```\n\n### Control our allow-lists and block-lists\n```js\n// allow only <b> elements, very strict\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {ALLOWED_TAGS: ['b']});\n\n// allow only <b> and <q> with style attributes\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {ALLOWED_TAGS: ['b', 'q'], ALLOWED_ATTR: ['style']});\n\n// allow all safe HTML elements but neither SVG nor MathML\n// note that the USE_PROFILES setting will override the ALLOWED_TAGS setting\n// so don't use them together\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {USE_PROFILES: {html: true}});\n\n// allow all safe SVG elements and SVG Filters, no HTML or MathML\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {USE_PROFILES: {svg: true, svgFilters: true}});\n\n// allow all safe MathML elements and SVG, but no SVG Filters\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {USE_PROFILES: {mathMl: true, svg: true}});\n\n// change the default namespace from HTML to something different\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {NAMESPACE: 'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'});\n\n// leave all safe HTML as it is and add <style> elements to block-list\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {FORBID_TAGS: ['style']});\n\n// leave all safe HTML as it is and add style attributes to block-list\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {FORBID_ATTR: ['style']});\n\n// extend the existing array of allowed tags and add <my-tag> to allow-list\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {ADD_TAGS: ['my-tag']});\n\n// extend the existing array of allowed attributes and add my-attr to allow-list\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {ADD_ATTR: ['my-attr']});\n\n// prohibit ARIA attributes, leave other safe HTML as is (default is true)\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {ALLOW_ARIA_ATTR: false});\n\n// prohibit HTML5 data attributes, leave other safe HTML as is (default is true)\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {ALLOW_DATA_ATTR: false});\n```\n\n### Control behavior relating to Custom Elements\n```js\n// DOMPurify allows to define rules for Custom Elements. When using the CUSTOM_ELEMENT_HANDLING\n// literal, it is possible to define exactly what elements you wish to allow (by default, none are allowed).\n//\n// The same goes for their attributes. By default, the built-in or configured allow.list is used.\n//\n// You can use a RegExp literal to specify what is allowed or a predicate, examples for both can be seen below.\n// The default values are very restrictive to prevent accidental XSS bypasses. Handle with great care!\n\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(\n    '<foo-bar baz=\"foobar\" forbidden=\"true\"></foo-bar><div is=\"foo-baz\"></div>',\n    {\n        CUSTOM_ELEMENT_HANDLING: {\n            tagNameCheck: null, // no custom elements are allowed\n            attributeNameCheck: null, // default / standard attribute allow-list is used\n            allowCustomizedBuiltInElements: false, // no customized built-ins allowed\n        },\n    }\n); // <div is=\"\"></div>\n\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(\n    '<foo-bar baz=\"foobar\" forbidden=\"true\"></foo-bar><div is=\"foo-baz\"></div>',\n    {\n        CUSTOM_ELEMENT_HANDLING: {\n            tagNameCheck: /^foo-/, // allow all tags starting with \"foo-\"\n            attributeNameCheck: /baz/, // allow all attributes containing \"baz\"\n            allowCustomizedBuiltInElements: true, // customized built-ins are allowed\n        },\n    }\n);

// will return a TrustedHTML object instead of a string if possible\n\n// use a provided Trusted Types policy\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {\n    // supplied policy must define createHTML and createScriptURL\n    TRUSTED_TYPES_POLICY: trustedTypes.createPolicy({\n        createHTML(s) { return s},\n        createScriptURL(s) { return s},\n    }\n});\n```\n### Influence how we sanitize\n```js\n// return entire document including <html> tags (default is false)\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {WHOLE_DOCUMENT: true});\n\n// disable DOM Clobbering protection on output (default is true, handle with care, minor XSS risks here)\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {SANITIZE_DOM: false});\n\n// enforce strict DOM Clobbering protection via namespace isolation (default is false)\n// when enabled, isolates the namespace of named properties (i.e., `id` and `name` attributes)\n// from JS variables by prefixing them with the string `user-content-`\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {SANITIZE_NAMED_PROPS: true});\n\n// keep an element's content when the element is removed (default is true)\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {KEEP_CONTENT: false});\n\n// glue elements like style, script or others to document.body and prevent unintuitive browser behavior in several edge-cases (default is false)\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {FORCE_BODY: true});\n\n// remove all <a> elements under <p> elements that are removed\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {FORBID_CONTENTS: ['a'], FORBID_TAGS: ['p']});\n\n// change the parser type so sanitized data is treated as XML and not as HTML, which is the default\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {PARSER_MEDIA_TYPE: 'application/xhtml+xml'});\n```\n### Influence where we sanitize\n```js\n// use the IN_PLACE mode to sanitize a node \"in place\", which is much faster depending on how you use DOMPurify\nconst dirty = document.createElement('a');\ndirty.setAttribute('href', 'javascript:alert(1)');\n\nconst clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirty, {IN_PLACE: true}); // see https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/issues/288 for more info\n```\n\nThere is even [more examples here](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/tree/main/demos#what-is-this), showing how you can run, customize and configure DOMPurify to fit your needs.\n\n## Persistent Configuration\n\nInstead of repeatedly passing the same configuration to `DOMPurify.sanitize`, you can use the `DOMPurify.setConfig` method. Your configuration will persist until your next call to `DOMPurify.setConfig`, or until you invoke `DOMPurify.clearConfig` to reset it. Remember that there is only one active configuration, which means once it is set, all extra configuration parameters passed to `DOMPurify.sanitize` are ignored.\n\n## Hooks\n\nDOMPurify allows you to augment its functionality by attaching one or more functions with the `DOMPurify.addHook` method to one of the following hooks:\n\n- `beforeSanitizeElements`\n- `uponSanitizeElement` (No 's' - called for every element)\n- `afterSanitizeElements`\n- `beforeSanitizeAttributes`\n- `uponSanitizeAttribute`\n- `afterSanitizeAttributes`\n- `beforeSanitizeShadowDOM`\n- `uponSanitizeShadowNode`\n- `afterSanitizeShadowDOM`\n\nIt passes the currently processed DOM node, when needed a literal with verified node and attribute data and the DOMPurify configuration to the callback. Check out the [MentalJS hook demo](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/blob/main/demos/hooks-mentaljs-demo.html) to see how the API can be used nicely.\n\n_Example_:\n\n```js\nDOMPurify.addHook(\n  'uponSanitizeAttribute',\n  function (currentNode, hookEvent, config) {\n    // Do something with the current node\n    // You can also mutate hookEvent for current node (i.e. set hookEvent.forceKeepAttr = true)\n    // For other than 'uponSanitizeAttribute' hook types hookEvent equals to null\n  }\n);\n```\n\n## Removed Configuration\n\n| Option          | Since | Note                     |\n|-----------------|-------|--------------------------|\n| SAFE_FOR_JQUERY | 2.1.0 | No replacement required. |\n\n## Continuous Integration\n\nWe are currently using Github Actions in combination with BrowserStack. This gives us the possibility to confirm for each and every commit that all is going according to plan in all supported browsers. Check out the build logs here: https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/actions\n\nYou can further run local tests by executing `npm test`. The tests work fine with Node.js v0.6.2 and jsdom@8.5.0.\n\nAll relevant commits will be signed with the key `0x24BB6BF4` for additional security (since 8th of April 2016).\n\n### Development and contributing\n\n#### Installation (`npm i`)\n\nWe support `npm` officially. GitHub Actions workflow is configured to install dependencies using `npm`. When using deprecated version of `npm` we can not fully ensure the versions of installed dependencies which might lead to unanticipated problems.\n\n#### Scripts\n\nWe rely on npm run-scripts for integrating with our tooling infrastructure. We use ESLint as a pre-commit hook to ensure code consistency. Moreover, to ease formatting we use [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) while building the `/dist` assets happens through `rollup`.\n\nThese are our npm scripts:\n\n- `npm run dev` to start building while watching sources for changes\n- `npm run test` to run our test suite via jsdom and karma\n  - `test:jsdom` to only run tests through jsdom\n  - `test:karma` to only run tests through karma\n- `npm run lint` to lint the sources using ESLint (via xo)\n- `npm run format` to format our sources using prettier to ease to pass ESLint\n- `npm run build` to build our distribution assets minified and unminified as a UMD module\n  - `npm run build:umd` to only build an unminified UMD module\n  - `npm run build:umd:min` to only build a minified UMD module\n\nNote: all run scripts triggered via `npm run <script>`.\n\nThere are more npm scripts but they are mainly to integrate with CI or are meant to be \"private\" for instance to amend build distribution files with every commit.\n\n## Security Mailing List\n\nWe maintain a mailing list that notifies whenever a security-critical release of DOMPurify was published. This means, if someone found a bypass and we fixed it with a release (which always happens when a bypass was found) a mail will go out to that list. This usually happens within minutes or few hours after learning about a bypass. The list can be subscribed to here:\n\n[https://lists.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/mailman/listinfo/dompurify-security](https://lists.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/mailman/listinfo/dompurify-security)\n\nFeature releases will not be announced to this list.\n\n## Who contributed?\n\nMany people helped and help DOMPurify become what it is and need to be acknowledged here!\n\n[hash_kitten ❤️](https://twitter.com/hash_kitten), [kevin_mizu ❤️](https://twitter.com/kevin_mizu), [icesfont ❤️](https://github.com/icesfont) [dcramer 💸](https://github.com/dcramer), [JGraph 💸](https://github.com/jgraph), [baekilda 💸](https://github.com/baekilda), [Healthchecks 💸](https://github.com/healthchecks), [Sentry 💸](https://github.com/getsentry), [jarrodldavis 💸](https://github.com/jarrodldavis), [CynegeticIO](https://github.com/CynegeticIO), [ssi02014 ❤️](https://github.com/ssi02014), [GrantGryczan](https://github.com/GrantGryczan), [Lowdefy](https://twitter.com/lowdefy), [granlem](https://twitter.com/MaximeVeit), [oreoshake](https://github.com/oreoshake), [tdeekens ❤️](https://github.com/tdeekens), [peernohell ❤️](https://github.com/peernohell), [is2ei](https://github.com/is2ei), [SoheilKhodayari](https://github.com/SoheilKhodayari), [franktopel](https://github.com/franktopel), [NateScarlet](https://github.com/NateScarlet), [neilj](https://github.com/neilj), [fhemberger](https://github.com/fhemberger), [Joris-van-der-Wel](https://github.com/Joris-van-der-Wel), [ydaniv](https://github.com/ydaniv), [terjanq](https://twitter.com/terjanq), [filedescriptor](https://github.com/filedescriptor), [ConradIrwin](https://github.com/ConradIrwin), [gibson042](https://github.com/gibson042), [choumx](https://github.com/choumx), [0xSobky](https://github.com/0xSobky), [styfle](https://github.com/styfle), [koto](https://github.com/koto), [tlau88](https://github.com/tlau88), [strugee](https://github.com/strugee), [oparoz](https://github.com/oparoz), [mathiasbynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens), [edg2s](https://github.com/edg2s), [dnkolegov](https://github.com/dnkolegov), [dhardtke](https://github.com/dhardtke), [wirehead](https://github.com/wirehead), [thorn0](https://github.com/thorn0), [styu](https://github.com/styu), [mozfreddyb](https://github.com/mozfreddyb), [mikesamuel](https://github.com/mikesamuel), [jorangreef](https://github.com/jorangreef), [jimmyhchan](https://github.com/jimmyhchan), [jameydeorio](https://github.com/jameydeorio), [jameskraus](https://github.com/jameskraus), [hyderali](https://github.com/hyderali), [hansottowirtz](https://github.com/hansottowirtz), [hackvertor](https://github.com/hackvertor), [freddyb](https://github.com/freddyb), [flavorjones](https://github.com/flavorjones), [djfarrelly](https://github.com/djfarrelly), [devd](https://github.com/devd), [camerondunford](https://github.com/camerondunford), [buu700](https://github.com/buu700), [buildog](https://github.com/buildog), [alabiaga](https://github.com/alabiaga), [Vector919](https://github.com/Vector919), [Robbert](https://github.com/Robbert), [GreLI](https://github.com/GreLI), [FuzzySockets](https://github.com/FuzzySockets), [ArtemBernatskyy](https://github.com/ArtemBernatskyy), [@garethheyes](https://twitter.com/garethheyes), [@shafigullin](https://twitter.com/shafigullin), [@mmrupp](https://twitter.com/mmrupp), [@irsdl](https://twitter.com/irsdl),[ShikariSenpai](https://github.com/ShikariSenpai), [ansjdnakjdnajkd](https://github.com/ansjdnakjdnajkd), [@asutherland](https://twitter.com/asutherland), [@mathias](https://twitter.com/mathias), [@cgvwzq](https://twitter.com/cgvwzq), [@robbertatwork](https://twitter.com/robbertatwork), [@giutro](https://twitter.com/giutro), [@CmdEngineer\\_](https://twitter.com/CmdEngineer_), [@avr4mit](https://twitter.com/avr4mit) and especially [@securitymb ❤️](https://twitter.com/securitymb) & [@masatokinugawa ❤️](https://twitter.com/masatokinugawa)\n\n## Testing powered by\n\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.browserstack.com/\"><img width=\"200\" src=\"https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/assets/6709482/f70be7eb-8fc4-41ea-9653-9d359235328f\"></a><br>\n\nAnd last but not least, thanks to [BrowserStack Open-Source Program](https://www.browserstack.com/open-source) for supporting this project with their services for free and delivering excellent, dedicated and very professional support on top of that.\n",

With time eventlet evolved and\nCPython too, but since several years the maintenance activity of eventlet\ndecreased leading to a growing gap between eventlet and the CPython\nimplementation.\n\nThis gap is now too high and can lead you to unexpected side effects and bugs\nin your applications.\n\nEventlet now follows a new maintenance policy. **Only maintenance for\nstability and bug fixing** will be provided. **No new features will be\naccepted**, except those related to the asyncio migration. **Usages in new\nprojects are discouraged**. **Our goal is to plan the retirement of eventlet**\nand to give you ways to move away from eventlet.\n\nIf you are looking for a library to manage async network programming,\nand if you do not yet use eventlet, then, we encourage you to use `asyncio`_,\nwhich is the official async library of the CPython stdlib.\n\nIf you already use eventlet, we hope to enable migration to asyncio for some use\ncases; see `Migrating off of Eventlet`_. Only new features related to the migration\nsolution will be accepted.\n\nIf you have questions concerning maintenance goals or concerning\nthe migration do not hesitate to `open a new issue`_, we will be happy to\nanswer them.\n\n.. _asyncio: https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html\n.. _open a new issue: https://github.com/eventlet/eventlet/issues/new\n.. _Migrating off of Eventlet: https://eventlet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/asyncio/migration.html#migration-guide\n\nEventlet\n========\n\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/eventlet\n    :target: https://pypi.org/project/eventlet/\n\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/eventlet/eventlet/test.yaml?branch=master\n    :target: https://github.com/eventlet/eventlet/actions?query=workflow%3Atest+branch%3Amaster\n\n.. image:: https://codecov.io/gh/eventlet/eventlet/branch/master/graph/badge.svg\n    :target: https://codecov.io/gh/eventlet/eventlet\n\n\nEventlet is a concurrent networking library for Python that allows you to change how you run your code, not how you write it.\n\nIt uses epoll or libevent for highly scalable non-blocking I/O.  Coroutines ensure that the developer uses a blocking style of programming that is similar to threading, but provide the benefits of non-blocking I/O.  The event dispatch is implicit, which means you can easily use Eventlet from the Python interpreter, or as a small part of a larger application.\n\nIt's easy to get started using Eventlet, and easy to convert existing\napplications to use it.  Start off by looking at the `examples`_,\n`common design patterns`_, and the list of `basic API primitives`_.\n\n.. _examples: https://eventlet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html\n.. _common design patterns: https://eventlet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/design_patterns.html\n.. _basic API primitives: https://eventlet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basic_usage.html\n\n\nGetting Eventlet\n================\n\nThe easiest way to get Eventlet is to use pip::\n\n  pip install -U eventlet\n\nTo install latest development version once::\n\n  pip install -U https://github.com/eventlet/eventlet/archive/master.zip\n\n\nBuilding the Docs Locally\n=========================\n\nTo build a complete set of HTML documentation::\n\n  tox -e docs\n\nThe built html files can be found in doc/build/html afterward.\n\nSupported Python versions\n=========================\n\nPython 3.7-3.12 are currently supported.\n",

Regardless, the server MUST close the\r\n> connection after responding to such a request to avoid the potential\r\n> attacks.\r\n\r\n> A server or client that receives an HTTP/1.0 message containing\r\n> a Transfer-Encoding header field MUST treat the message as if the\r\n> framing is faulty, even if a Content-Length is present, and close the\r\n> connection after processing the message. The message sender might have\r\n> retained a portion of the message, in buffer, that could be\r\n> misinterpreted by further use of the connection.\r\n\r\nThe following request would lead to this scenario:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPOST / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: a.com\r\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\r\nContent-Length: 0\r\nContent-Type: application/x-\"##-form-urlencoded\r\n14\r\nid=1'or sleep(1);###\r\n0\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith these changes, when this kind of request is received the connection is closed and an error 400 is returned.\r\n\r\nThis scenario can be tested by using the following process:\r\n\r\n1. run a wsgi server either: \r\n- by using the wsgi sample in official examples (http://eventlet.net/doc/examples.html#wsgi-server) \r\n- or by using my previous patch (https://github.com/eventlet/eventlet/pull/825) that allow you to run wsgi server from the command line (`$ eventlet_wsgi_example`)\r\n2. send the following HTTP request to the running server:\r\n```\r\ncurl -d \"param1=value1&param2=value2\" -X POST -H 'Transfer-Encoding:\r\nchunked' -H 'Content-Length: 0' --http1.1 http://0.0.0.0:8090 -i\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe previous curl command display returned headers and status code. You can observe that now, with these changes, bad requests are rejected.\r\n\r\n These changes also remove `content-lenght` from the `chunk` tests to avoid reflecting something that's not a bad practice.\r\n\r\nThis security issue was originally discovered by Keran Mu (mkr22@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn) and Jianjun Chen\r\n(jianjun@tsinghua.edu.cn), from Tsinghua University and Zhongguancun Laboratory\r\n\r\nThanks to them for raising our attention about this security problem.",

This is why Transfer-Encoding is defined as overriding Content-Length, as opposed to them being mutually incompatible.\r\n> \r\n> Given that, should we maybe make this in some way configurable, but defaulting to the more-secure behavior? That would allow us an escape hatch for working with old clients that cannot be updated (for example, because their source code may have been lost), particularly if the operator and/or application developer know that the service will not be forwarding any messages.\r\n\r\nTotally agree with the \"configurable but defaulting to the more secure behavior\" path. I'll rework my patch to introduce an option.\r\n \r\n> \r\n> I'd also like to note that since we're relying on stdlib's HTTP parsing, there are still cases where a client may send both headers but we don't 400. See also: [python/cpython#81274](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/81274) and #574 (which unfortunately I never properly followed up on).\r\n\r\nThanks for the heads up.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> That said, I agree, [the danger is certainly real](https://bugs.launchpad.net/swift/+bug/1840507).\r\n\r\n",

                "body": "Reject requests which contains headers `content-length` and `transfer-encoding` at the same time.\r\n\r\nThat's not allowed by RFC 9112 and that could lead to potential security attacks.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112#section-6.1-15\r\n\r\nThis is an extract of the RFC:\r\n\r\n> A server MAY reject a request that contains both Content-Length and\r\n> Transfer-Encoding or process such a request in accordance with the\r\n> Transfer-Encoding alone. Regardless, the server MUST close the\r\n> connection after responding to such a request to avoid the potential\r\n> attacks.\r\n\r\n> A server or client that receives an HTTP/1.0 message containing\r\n> a Transfer-Encoding header field MUST treat the message as if the\r\n> framing is faulty, even if a Content-Length is present, and close the\r\n> connection after processing the message. The message sender might have\r\n> retained a portion of the message, in buffer, that could be\r\n> misinterpreted by further use of the connection.\r\n\r\nThe following request would lead to this scenario:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPOST / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: a.com\r\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\r\nContent-Length: 0\r\nContent-Type: application/x-\"##-form-urlencoded\r\n14\r\nid=1'or sleep(1);###\r\n0\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith these changes, when this kind of request is received the connection is closed and an error 400 is returned.\r\n\r\nThis scenario can be tested by using the following process:\r\n\r\n1. run a wsgi server either: \r\n- by using the wsgi sample in official examples (http://eventlet.net/doc/examples.html#wsgi-server) \r\n- or by using my previous patch (https://github.com/eventlet/eventlet/pull/825) that allow you to run wsgi server from the command line (`$ eventlet_wsgi_example`)\r\n2. send the following HTTP request to the running server:\r\n```\r\ncurl -d \"param1=value1&param2=value2\" -X POST -H 'Transfer-Encoding:\r\nchunked' -H 'Content-Length: 0' --http1.1 http://0.0.0.0:8090 -i\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe previous curl command display returned headers and status code. You can observe that now, with these changes, bad requests are rejected.\r\n\r\n These changes also remove `content-lenght` from the `chunk` tests to avoid reflecting something that's not a bad practice.\r\n\r\nThis security issue was originally discovered by Keran Mu (mkr22@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn) and Jianjun Chen\r\n(jianjun@tsinghua.edu.cn), from Tsinghua University and Zhongguancun Laboratory\r\n\r\nThanks to them for raising our attention about this security problem.",

This is why Transfer-Encoding is defined as overriding Content-Length, as opposed to them being mutually incompatible.\r\n> \r\n> Given that, should we maybe make this in some way configurable, but defaulting to the more-secure behavior? That would allow us an escape hatch for working with old clients that cannot be updated (for example, because their source code may have been lost), particularly if the operator and/or application developer know that the service will not be forwarding any messages.\r\n\r\nTotally agree with the \"configurable but defaulting to the more secure behavior\" path. I'll rework my patch to introduce an option.\r\n \r\n> \r\n> I'd also like to note that since we're relying on stdlib's HTTP parsing, there are still cases where a client may send both headers but we don't 400. See also: [python/cpython#81274](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/81274) and #574 (which unfortunately I never properly followed up on).\r\n\r\nThanks for the heads up.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> That said, I agree, [the danger is certainly real](https://bugs.launchpad.net/swift/+bug/1840507).\r\n\r\n",

For older versions, please check [previous releases](https://github.com/appwrite/sdk-for-cli/releases).**\n\nAppwrite is an open-source backend as a service server that abstract and simplify complex and repetitive development tasks behind a very simple to use REST API. Appwrite aims to help you develop your apps faster and in a more secure way. Use the Command Line SDK to integrate your app with the Appwrite server to easily start interacting with all of Appwrite backend APIs and tools. For full API documentation and tutorials go to [https://appwrite.io/docs](https://appwrite.io/docs)\n\n![Appwrite](https://github.com/appwrite/appwrite/raw/main/public/images/github.png)\n\n## Installation\n\nThe Appwrite CLI is a Node based command line tool to help you interact with the Appwrite API. The CLI is distributed both as an [`npm package`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/appwrite-cli) as well as [pre built binaries](https://github.com/appwrite/sdk-for-cli/releases/latest) for specific operating systems and architectures.\n\n### Install using NPM\n---\n\nIf you have `npm` installed, it's as easy as running\n\n```sh\n$ npm install -g appwrite-cli\n```\n\nOnce the installation is complete, you can verify the install using\n\n```sh\n$ appwrite -v\n6.1.0\n```\n\n### Install using prebuilt binaries\n---\n\nIf you do not have `npm` installed, you can always install the prebuilt binaries for your architecture and OS using our convenient installation scripts.\n\n### Linux / MacOS Terminal\n```bash\n$ wget -q https://appwrite.io/cli/install.sh  -O - | /bin/bash\n```\n\n### MacOS via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)\n```bash\n$ brew install appwrite \n```\n\n### Windows\nVia Powershell\n```powershell\n$ iwr -useb https://appwrite.io/cli/install.ps1 | iex\n```\nVia [Scoop](https://scoop.sh)\n```powershell\n$ scoop install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/appwrite/sdk-for-cli/master/scoop/appwrite.json\n```\n\nOnce the installation completes, you can verify your install using\n```\n$ appwrite -v\n6.1.0\n```\n\n## Getting Started \n\nBefore you can use the CLI, you need to login to your Appwrite account. \n\n```sh\n$ appwrite login\n\n? Enter your email test@test.com\n? Enter your password ********\n✓ Success \n```\nThis will also prompt you to enter your Appwrite endpoint ( default: http://localhost/v1 ) \n\n* ### Initialising your project\nOnce logged in, the CLI needs to be initialised before you can use it with your Appwrite project. You can do this with the `appwrite init project` command. \n\n```sh\n$ appwrite init project\n```\n\nThe following prompt will guide you through the setup process. The `init` command also creates an `appwrite.json` file representing your Appwrite project.\n\nThe `appwrite.json` file does a lot of things. \n* Provides context to the CLI\n* Keeps track of all your cloud functions\n* Keeps track of all your project's collections\n* Helps you deploy your Appwrite project to production and more..\n\nYou can also fetch all the collections in your current project using\n```sh\nappwrite init collection\n```\n\n* ### Creating and deploying cloud functions\n\nThe CLI makes it extremely easy to create and deploy Appwrite's cloud functions. Initialise your new function using\n\n```\n$ appwrite init function\n? What would you like to name your function? My Awesome Function\n? What runtime would you like to use? Node.js (node-15.5)\n✓ Success \n```\n\nThis will create a new function `My Awesome Function` in your current Appwrite project and also create a template function for you to get started.\n\n```sh\n$ tree My\\ Awesome\\ Function \n\nMy Awesome Function\n├── README.md\n├── index.js\n├── package-lock.json\n└── package.json\n\n0 directories, 4 files\n```\n\nYou can now deploy this function using \n\n```sh\n$ appwrite deploy function\n\n? Which functions would you like to deploy? My Awesome Function (61d1a4c81dfcd95bc834)\nℹ Info Deploying function My Awesome Function ( 61d1a4c81dfcd95bc834 )\n✓ Success Deployed My Awesome Function ( 61d1a4c81dfcd95bc834 )\n```\n\nYour function has now been deployed on your Appwrite server! As soon as the build process is finished, you can start executing the function.\n\n* ### Deploying Collections\n\nSimilarly, you can deploy all your collections to your Appwrite server using \n\n```sh\nappwrite deploy collections\n```\n\n> ### Note\n> By default, requests to domains with self signed SSL certificates (or no certificates) are disabled. If you trust the domain, you can bypass the certificate validation using\n```sh\n$ appwrite client --selfSigned true\n```\n\n## Usage \n\nThe Appwrite CLI follows the following general syntax.\n```sh\n$ appwrite [COMMAND] --[OPTIONS]\n```\n\nA few sample commands to get you started \n\n```sh\n$ appwrite users create --userId \"unique()\" --email hello@appwrite.io --password very_strong_password\n$ appwrite users list \n```\n\nTo create a document you can use the following command \n```sh\n$ appwrite database createDocument --collectionId <ID> --documentId 'unique()' --data '{ \"Name\": \"Iron Man\" }' --permissions 'read(\"any\")' 'read(\"team:abc\")'\n```\n\n### Some Gotchas\n- `data` must be a valid JSON string where each key and value are enclosed in double quotes `\"` like the example above.\n- Some arguments like the `read` and `write` permissions are expected to be arrays. In the Appwrite CLI, array values are passed in using space as a separator like in the example above.\n\n\nTo get information about the different services available, you can use \n```sh\n$ appwrite -h\n```\n\nTo get information about a particular service and the commands available in a service you can use \n```sh\n$ appwrite users // or\n$ appwrite users --help // or\n$ appwrite users help // or\n$ appwrite accounts\n```\n\nTo get information about a particular command and the parameters it accepts, you can use\n\n```sh\n$ appwrite users list --help\n$ appwrite account get --help \n```\n\nAt any point, you can view or reset the CLI configuration using the `client` service.\n\n```\n$ appwrite client --debug\n// This will display your endpoint, projectID, API key and so on.\n$ appwrite client --reset\n```\n\n## CI mode\n\nThe Appwrite CLI can also work in a CI environment. The initialisation of the CLI works a bit differently in CI. In CI, you set your `endpoint`, `projectId` and `API Key` using \n\n```sh\nappwrite client --endpoint http://localhost/v1 --projectId <PROJECT_ID> --key <API KEY>\n```\n\n## Contribution\n\nThis library is auto-generated by Appwrite custom [SDK Generator](https://github.com/appwrite/sdk-generator). To learn more about how you can help us improve this SDK, please check the [contribution guide](https://github.com/appwrite/sdk-generator/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before sending a pull-request.\n\nTo build and test the CLI for development, follow these steps \n\n1. Clone the SDK Generator repository and cd into the directory\n```sh\n$ git clone https://github.com/appwrite/sdk-generator\n$ cd sdk-generator\n```\n\n2. Ensure Docker is running locally and then install the composer dependencies using\n```sh \n$ docker run --rm --interactive --tty --volume \"$(pwd)\":/app composer install --ignore-platform-reqs --optimize-autoloader --no-plugins --no-scripts --prefer-dist\n\n# Generate the SDKs\n$ docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app -w /app php:8.1-cli php example.php\n```\n\n3. Head over to the generated SDK and install the dependencies.\n```sh\n$ cd examples/cli\n$ npm install \n```\n\n4. Install the CLI using \n```sh\n$ npm install -g .\n```\n\n5. You can now use the CLI \n```sh\n$ appwrite -v\n```\n## License\n\nPlease see the [BSD-3-Clause license](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/appwrite/appwrite/master/LICENSE) file for more information.\n",

It does _not_ support PyPy and other Python implementations as it cannot provide its restrictions there.\n\nFor full documentation please see http://restrictedpython.readthedocs.io/.\n\nExample\n=======\n\nTo give a basic understanding what RestrictedPython does here two examples:\n\nAn unproblematic code example\n-----------------------------\n\nPython allows you to execute a large set of commands.\nThis would not harm any system.\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> from RestrictedPython import compile_restricted\n    >>> from RestrictedPython import safe_globals\n    >>>\n    >>> source_code = \"\"\"\n    ... def example():\n    ...     return 'Hello World!'\n    ... \"\"\"\n    >>>\n    >>> loc = {}\n    >>> byte_code = compile_restricted(source_code, '<inline>', 'exec')\n    >>> exec(byte_code, safe_globals, loc)\n    >>>\n    >>> loc['example']()\n    'Hello World!'\n\nProblematic code example\n------------------------\n\nThis example directly executed in Python could harm your system.\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> from RestrictedPython import compile_restricted\n    >>> from RestrictedPython import safe_globals\n    >>>\n    >>> source_code = \"\"\"\n    ... import os\n    ...\n    ... os.listdir('/')\n    ... \"\"\"\n    >>> byte_code = compile_restricted(source_code, '<inline>', 'exec')\n    >>> exec(byte_code, safe_globals, {})\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n    ImportError: __import__ not found\n\nContributing to RestrictedPython\n--------------------------------\n\nIf you want to help maintain RestrictedPython and contribute, please refer to\nthe documentation `Contributing page\n<https://restrictedpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/index.html>`_.\n",

Seriously though:  \nIt has the [most common features](#general-commands) of many chatbots (!flip, !8, stopwatch, etc.), **custom commands** (inspired by Twitch's [Nightbot](https://www.nightbot.tv/)), memes.  \nIt features some games such as **Trivia**, rock paper scissors, [users can earn and play with credits](#economy-commands) in the slot machine.  \n[The audio part is quite fleshed out](#audio-commands). Users can **stream youtube videos**, create **playlists** that everyone will be able to play and control (previous/next song, pause/resume, shuffle...).  \n**MP3 and flac files can also be streamed** (see [FAQ](#faq) for details on local playlists)  \n**Twitch's online notifications**: Red will notify the channels you want whenever you favorite Twitch streamers are online.  \nAs for the moderation tools, it includes a **powerful message filter with regular expression capabilities** and **mass messages cleanup**.  \n[I'm planning to expand all this much more](#todo-list).  \nSee the [command list](#general-commands) for an even better idea of what this bot can do.\n\n### I don't even know what I'm looking at. How do I install this?\nDo not panic. [Enter the wiki and follow the tutorials](https://github.com/Twentysix26/Red-DiscordBot/wiki)!  \nIf you have any issue, consult the [troubleshooting](https://github.com/Twentysix26/Red-DiscordBot/wiki/Troubleshooting) page, and if you're still stuck, [join the official server](https://discord.gg/0k4npTwMvTpv9wrh) so you can get some help.\nOnce you're done, take a look at the command list and have fun.\n\n### General commands\n\n| Command                                       | Description                                |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| !flip                                         | Flip a coin                                |\n| !rps [rock/paper/scissors]                    | Play  RPS                                  |\n| !proverb                                      | Random proverb                             |\n| !choose [option1 or option2 or option3 (...)] | Random choice.

Were you drunk when you coded this?  \n\nYou're probably missing something.  \nFeel free to join [my server](https://discord.gg/0k4npTwMvTpv9wrh) and head to #support to get some help! Oh, and my drinking habits are none of your business.  \n\n>Does this bot work on multiple servers?  \n\nSure it does. Should you do it? Maybe. The permissions system is not that great at the moment but if you trust the people running the server it's ok. It's not advisable to send the bot in random servers at the moment.   \nCustom commands only work in the server they were created in. Same for the message filter. This is by design. Also, remember that the bot can only be in one voice channel at once.\n\n>Will you implement [feature]?  \n\nSuggestions are always very welcome.\n\n>How do local playlists work?\n\nMake as many folders as you want inside the localtracks folder. Names must be without spaces. Every folder counts as a different playlist. Every playlist can contain mp3 and flac files. Users can stream them by doing !local [playlist_name] and see the full list\nwith !local or !locallist. They can also add tracks to their favorites.\n\n>What's download mode?\n\nEverytime you play the audio of a youtube video with download mode on the audio will be first downloaded and stored into the \"cache\" folder. It is recommended that you use this mode to avoid streaming problems. This is the default mode, you can switch between modes with !downloadmode.\n\n>Why is this bot called Red and the admin role \"Transistor\"? What's the meaning of !sing?\n\nThey're all references to [Transistor](https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/transistor/), a videogame by Supergiant Games.\n\n### TODO List\n- [x] [Start rewriting Red](https://github.com/Twentysix26/Red-DiscordBot/tree/develop)\n- [ ]  ~~Bundle some malware and slowly build up a botnet for world domination~~\n",

We therefore think of pretix as being stable and ready to use.\n\nIf you want to use or extend pretix, we strongly recommend to follow our `blog`_. We will announce all\nreleases there. You can always find the latest stable version on PyPI or in the ``release/X.Y`` branch of\nthis repository. The ``master`` branch contains a development version that we also try to keep stable in\nthe sense that it does not break your data,  but its APIs might change without prior notice.\n\nTo get started using pretix on your own server, look at the `installation guide`_ in our documentation.\n\nSupport\n-------\n\nThis project is 100 percent free and open source software. You are welcome to ask questions in the GitHub\nrepository. Private support via email or phone is only offered to customers of our pretix Hosted or pretix\nEnterprise offerings. If you are interested in commercial support, hosting services or supporting this project\nfinancially, please go to `pretix.eu`_ or contact us at support@pretix.eu.\n\nContributing\n------------\nIf you want to contribute to pretix, please read the `developer documentation`_\nin our documentation.

Our full documentation is available on `ipython.readthedocs.io\n<https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ and contains information on how to install, use, and\ncontribute to the project.\nIPython (Interactive Python) is a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages, originally developed for the Python programming language, that offers introspection, rich media, shell syntax, tab completion, and history.\n\n**IPython versions and Python Support**\n\nStarting after IPython 8.16, we will progressively transition to `Spec-0000 <https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0000/>`_.\n\nStarting with IPython 7.10, IPython follows `NEP 29 <https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html>`_\n\n**IPython 7.17+** requires Python version 3.7 and above.\n\n**IPython 7.10+** requires Python version 3.6 and above.\n\n**IPython 7.0** requires Python version 3.5 and above.\n\n**IPython 6.x** requires Python version 3.3 and above.\n\n**IPython 5.x LTS** is the compatible release for Python 2.7.\nIf you require Python 2 support, you **must** use IPython 5.x LTS. Please\nupdate your project configurations and requirements as necessary.\n\n\nThe Notebook, Qt console and a number of other pieces are now parts of *Jupyter*.\nSee the `Jupyter installation docs <https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html>`__\nif you want to use these.\n\nMain features of IPython\n========================\nComprehensive object introspection.\n\nInput history, persistent across sessions.\n\nCaching of output results during a session with automatically generated references.\n\nExtensible tab completion, with support by default for completion of python variables and keywords, filenames and function keywords.\n\nExtensible system of ‘magic’ commands for controlling the environment and performing many tasks related to IPython or the operating system.\n\nA rich configuration system with easy switching between different setups (simpler than changing $PYTHONSTARTUP environment variables every time).\n\nSession logging and reloading.\n\nExtensible syntax processing for special purpose situations.\n\nAccess to the system shell with user-extensible alias system.\n\nEasily embeddable in other Python programs and GUIs.\n\nIntegrated access to the pdb debugger and the Python profiler.\n\n\nDevelopment and Instant running\n===============================\n\nYou can find the latest version of the development documentation on `readthedocs\n<https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.\n\nYou can run IPython from this directory without even installing it system-wide\nby typing at the terminal::\n\n   $ python -m IPython\n\nOr see the `development installation docs\n<https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/install.html#installing-the-development-version>`_\nfor the latest revision on read the docs.\n\nDocumentation and installation instructions for older version of IPython can be\nfound on the `IPython website <https://ipython.org/documentation.html>`_\n\n\nAlternatives to IPython\n=======================\n\nIPython may not be to your taste; if that's the case there might be similar\nproject that you might want to use:\n\n- The classic Python REPL.\n- `bpython <https://bpython-interpreter.org/>`_\n- `mypython <https://www.asmeurer.com/mypython/>`_\n- `ptpython and ptipython <https://pypi.org/project/ptpython/>`_\n- `Xonsh <https://xon.sh/>`_\n\nIgnoring commits with git blame.ignoreRevsFile\n==============================================\n\nAs of git 2.23, it is possible to make formatting changes without breaking\n``git blame``. See the `git documentation\n<https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-blameignoreRevsFile>`_\nfor more details.\n\nTo use this feature you must:\n\n- Install git >= 2.23\n- Configure your local git repo by running:\n   - POSIX: ``tools\\configure-git-blame-ignore-revs.sh``\n   - Windows:  ``tools\\configure-git-blame-ignore-revs.bat``\n",

                "body": "Hi IPython,\r\n\r\nFirst off, I'd like to say how much I enjoy using IPython - I use it every day. Recently I've begun work on a [static analysis tool](https://github.com/dlint-py/dlint) for Python code. I ran a subset of its rules against the IPython code base and received some interesting results. In particular, Dlint's checks for `shell=True` subprocess calls:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ python3 -m flake8 --select=DUO116 ipython/IPython/\r\nipython/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py:2482:22: DUO116 use of \"shell=True\" is insecure in \"subprocess\" module\r\nipython/IPython/core/hooks.py:80:12: DUO116 use of \"shell=True\" is insecure in \"subprocess\" module\r\nipython/IPython/core/page.py:214:24: DUO116 use of \"shell=True\" is insecure in \"subprocess\" module\r\nipython/IPython/lib/editorhooks.py:55:16: DUO116 use of \"shell=True\" is insecure in \"subprocess\" module\r\nipython/IPython/utils/_process_common.py:79:9: DUO116 use of \"shell=True\" is insecure in \"subprocess\" module\r\nipython/IPython/utils/sysinfo.py:58:12: DUO116 use of \"shell=True\" is insecure in \"subprocess\" module\r\n```\r\n\r\nI manually investigated each finding with the following results:\r\n\r\n* `interactiveshell.py`: Unclear if vulnerable, unclear if `shell=True` is necessary\r\n* `hooks.py`: Vulnerable via `$EDITOR, shell=True` unnecessary\r\n* `page.py`: Vulnerable via `$PAGER`, `shell=True` unnecessary\r\n* `editorhooks.py`: Unclear if vulnerable, unclear if shell=True is necessary\r\n* `_process_commend.py`: Unclear if vulnerable, seems shell=True is necessary\r\n* `sysinfo.py`: Not vulnerable, `shell=True` unnecessary\r\n\r\nThe following demonstrates the vulnerabilities in hooks and page:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ PAGER='echo \"pager\" > /tmp/pager' ipython -c \"open??\"\r\n$ cat /tmp/pager\r\npager\r\n```\r\n```\r\n$ EDITOR='echo \"editor\" > /tmp/editor' ipython -c \"%edit\"\r\n$ cat /tmp/editor\r\neditor\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis issue is highlighted in the Python subprocess docs: [Subprocess Security Considerations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#security-considerations). This issue falls under CWE-77: [Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/77.html). I would recommend avoiding `shell=True` whenever possible and investigating the other findings and ensuring they do not have the same issue. It appears that most of the calls do not need shell functionality anyway.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you need any additional information!",

                        "body": "Note: This conversation already happen on the security mailing list and is posted in public for transparency. \r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\n@Carreau replied\r\n\r\nHi Matt,\r\n\r\nMany thanks for the kind words, and thanks for the report, and for\r\npointing us to dlint..\r\n\r\nA few questions and discussion though.\r\nAs far as I understand,  \"Command injection\" usually refer to\r\napplication that are not meant to run arbitrary command. But do so\r\nunder adversarial user input.\r\n\r\n1) The goal of IPython **is** to run arbitrary commands; If you run\r\ncan run IPython, or enter commands into it you don't need to modify\r\n$PAGER or $EDITOR to execute arbitrary commands. I'm also unsure how\r\nan attacker would modify those env variable or provide adversarial\r\ninput.\r\n2) I believe the `shell=True` is necessary (at least ini `$EDITOR`) in\r\nboth the case you outline we do want to explicitly run arbitrary\r\ncommands. For example $EDITOR='atom -w' to have a blocking GUI editor\r\nafter calling `%edit`. `Shell=False` will say `no such command 'atom\r\n-w'` – I guess those can be handled by `shlex.split()`, but other like\r\nipython -c '%sx echo \"onpurpose\" > /tmp/onpurpose' really must use\r\nshell (sx stands for shell execute).\r\n\r\nSo I'd like to better understand what your threat model is, or would\r\nbe for such attacks.\r\nDoes \"Command injection\" really make sens when the goal of the project\r\nis arbitrary code  execution, or if I misunderstood some of the issues\r\nbehind command injections.\r\n\r\nI understand that some of the above would be cleaner w/o shell=True,\r\nat least to show good practice.\r\n\r\nLet us know what you think, and wether there is a need to keep this\r\nprivate; in which case i'm open to have this public on the IPython\r\nrepo and/or do a security advisory.\r\n\r\n---- \r\n\r\n@takluyver replied\r\n\r\n$PAGER can also include options, e.g. \"less -R\". So we can't easily switch away from shell=True there.\r\n\r\nThe threat model here would have to be an attacker that can set environment variables for a context where IPython will be used, but not give IPython commands directly or write anywhere on the filesystem (because if you can do that, you can point one of these environment variables to a script you've written, which gets run even with 'shell=False'). I imagine you can come up with some scenario like that, but given how IPython is designed to be used, I suspect those scenarios are pretty unlikely. If you figure out potential improvements in that area, I'd discuss them in the open rather than through the private security channels.\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\n@mschwager replied\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nThanks for the clarifications. Based on your inputs it seems that there isn't much that can be done. Though I'd say avoiding shell=True is still a good practice :)\r\n\r\nSince IPython is mostly a CLI/development-focused tool, it's unlikely that it's used in such a way where these concerns are exploitable. However, there are probably places where it's being used in an unusual, hard to envision scenario. Further, the attacker would have to be somewhat constrained. As already mentioned, the attacker would have to be able to set env variables but not files on the filesystem. But even in this situation, defensive programming (such as shlex or no shell) wouldn't stop something like: EDITOR='python -c \"<arbitrary code>\"' ipython ...\r\n\r\nIf we consider some of the previously mentioned concerns:\r\nRequiring arguments to script, e.g. 'atom -w': we could avoid shell=True here by using shlex.split. Although this still falls into trouble with the arbitrary code example above.\r\nHandling shell execute functionality, e.g. '%sx': there's not much to be done here, this is the intended behavior :)\r\nThinking about shell=True a bit more... I believe this is most dangerous when user input is being concatenated with an existing string. For example, consider the following:\r\n\r\ncmd = 'ls -l {}'\r\ncmd = cmd.format(cmd, user_input_directory)\r\nsubprocess.Popen(cmd, shell=True)\r\n\r\nThe dangerous part here is that user input could be 'foo; rm -rf /'. Adding shell=True enables multiple commands with ';'. Although the IPython codebase doesn't contain this behavior (or at least doesn't where code execution isn't intended).\r\n\r\nAll in all I'd say that there's no security issues here. Although I would say shlex instead of shell=True would generally be better practice.\r\n\r\nI appreciate all your feedback here and quick responses. I can use this to improve Dlint's analysis capabilities.\r\n\r\n",

Are there any other options that could be implemented? I'm sure that other people are interested in this as well especially now that Docker is a viable means provisioning per user notebooks.\n\n   What I am trying to do specifically is to add an HTTP Authorization header to each request that contains an authentication token, and have the handlers verify the validity of the token before servicing the request. Its easy to do and a common approach. I actually need access to the token for backend web service requests. I can override the front end HTML templates and have already modified the javascript to add the headers to the ajax requests, but I am blocked on the backend.\n\n   An alternative might be to setup configurable handlers for /login and /logout and have the front end register the authentication token with the login handler and receive a secure session cookie that references the . Code on the backend such as notebook handlers would have to have access to the session object to authenticate the user for access to data.\n\n   What do people think?\n   Steve\n",

Then the proxy would handle auth.\n\nAnyway, if you think specifically at one way to do that, I suggest for you to draft a proposal and/or submit a pull request.\n\nI would also suggest looking at `DottedObjectName` configurable, that can allow to use custom class for some object in IPython.\n\nYou can probably have a look at [bookstore](https://github.com/rgbkrk/bookstore) a python package that allow to use rackspace as a storage backend. \n\nIt is a good example of how to use that with a 4 config line (extract from above link) : \n\n```\n# Setup IPython Notebook to write notebooks to CloudFiles\nc.NotebookApp.notebook_manager_class = 'bookstore.cloudfiles.CloudFilesNotebookManager'\n\n# Set your user name and API Key\nc.CloudFilesNotebookManager.account_name = USER_NAME\nc.CloudFilesNotebookManager.account_key = API_KEY\n\n# Container on CloudFiles\nc.CloudFilesNotebookManager.container_name = u'notebooks'\n```\n",

However if you look at how pluggable authentication is handled in other web platforms, you'll probably see that what I suggested is a fairly conventional approach to dealing with a reasonable number of use cases. I would rather not fork the IPython core and send a PR without a reasonable belief that it would be acceptable to the IPython core devs - so some reasonable guidance about what would be acceptable/unacceptable in terms of design decisions would be helpful.\n\nAs far as having a front end proxy that instantiates new per user notebook instances, as you're no doubt aware, there's a bunch of people working on docker based solutions. We implemented a proof of concept with an nginx proxy + jiffylab, but I can't work on further it for a few weeks. I promised Paul Ivanov that I would upload the current duct tape and bailing wire prototype but haven't been able to scrape together the time for that yet. In the long term, my plan is to move most of the current jiffylab functionality into Nginx and enforce some level of authentication in the Nginx handlers - however that is a couple of months away, and will likely be using the Nginx embedded lua interpreter instead of python. It also doesn't solve the problem of making the authentication token available to a backend services like the notebook manager.\n\nThe example you posted uses a static username and password, so it doesn't support permissions based on user authentication. Thats really the problem, there needs to be a way to pass an authentication token from the web client through to the notebook manager and similar notebook server services, as well as a way to pass it through to the kernel - I implemented a monkeypatching solution for now on the notebook server and a parallel solution with frontend javascript calling into the kernel, but those are just hacks to get around the lack of support. I'll write up a strawman proposal to initiate discussion as you suggested, but it may take a couple of weeks until I'm past the current delivery crunch.\n\n   Steve\n",

If WE_HAVE_TLS is\nset to True, it will suggest you better use the https site and link there.\n\nAdditionally, the service administrator can implement a redirect from the\nhttp to the https site within the webserver configuration for the WWW_HOST.\nThe redirect should **not** be implemented for WWW_IPV4_HOST and WWW_IPV6_HOST\nas it is unknown whether all update clients can deal with a redirect (and\nsupport TLS).\n\nFor the router / update client configuration examples we show when creating a\nupdate secret, we use update URLs with https: (and we also tell why it might\nnot work).\n\nOn the hosts overview page, we show whether we received the last update via TLS.\n\nPlease note that if you like security, you also need to use https (with\ncertificate verification) if you use the web-based method to query your IP\naddress. If you use http, a powerful attacker could MITM your request and\ntell you a wrong IP, which your updater then would happily write into DNS.\n\n\nLogin with remote vs. local Account\n===================================\n\nIf you use a already existing remote account to log in into our service, you\ndon't need to create a local profile (with username, E-Mail and password).\n\nThat way, we need to store less information about you - especially no password\nhash (and you also don't need to create a new password just for our service).\nSo, this is a little more safe if you just consider our service.\n\nBUT: If you use some external service to log in, you of course need to trust\nthem for this purpose as *they* are telling \"yes, this is really you\".\n\nAlso, if you cancel the account on that external service and you don't have\na local profile (login, E-Mail, password) with us, you will be unable to log\nin afterwards or recover access to your hosts/domains.\n\nSo maybe the best way is to first create a local profile (username, E-Mail,\npassword), then log in and associate your other remote accounts with that\nlocal profile.\n\n\nPasswords / Secrets / Keys\n==========================\n\nInteractive login password\n--------------------------\n\nWe recommend that you use a rather strong and not guessable password for this.\nDo not re-use passwords, use a password system or a password manager.\n\nThe interactive login password for the web site is stored using Django's\ndefault hasher mechanism, which is currently pbkdf2 (a very strong and\nintentionally slow password hash). Brute-Force attacks against such hashes are\nvery slow, much slower than against simple hashes like (s)sha1/sha256 etc.\n\nIt is NOT stored in clear text by nsupdate.info.\n\nIf you lose the password, you'll have to do a password reset via e-mail.\n\n\nAutomated update secret\n-----------------------\n\nThe automated update secret for routers or other update clients is a\nrandom and automatically generated secret. We store it using the sha1 hasher\nof Django (which in fact is salted-sha1, a not very strong, but fast-to-compute\nhash).\n\nConsidering that a lot of routers or update clients store this secret in clear\ntext in their configuration and often transmit it using unencrypted http (and\nnot https), this secret is not too safe anyway. We also wanted to save some cpu\ncycles here and rather not use pbkdf2 for this regularly and automatically used\nsecret.\n\nIt is not stored in clear text by nsupdate.info.\n\nIf you lose the secret, you'll have to generate a new one and change it in your\nupdate client also.\n\nWe use a random and automatically generated update secret to avoid that users\nenter a bad password here (like reusing a password they use somewhere else,\nchoosing a too simple password) and to avoid disclosure of such user-chosen\npasswords in case the hashes ever get stolen and brute forced.\n\n\nNameserver Update Secret (backend, RFC 2136)\n--------------------------------------------\n\nWe currently store this secret (which is basically a base64 encoded shared secret,\none per dynamic zone) \"as is\" into the database (\"Domain\" records there).\n\nThis is somehow critical, but also hard to do better - encryption would only\nhelp very little here as we would need to decrypt the update secret before using it,\nso we would need the unlocked decryption key on the same machine.\n\nMake sure no unauthorized person gets that secret or he/she will be able to update\nANY record in the respective zone / nameserver directly (without going over\nnsupdate.info software / service).\n\nWe support creating a random update secret, so you don't need an extra tool for this.\n\n\nOther Services Update Secret (dyndns2 client)\n---------------------------------------------\n\nWe need to store this secret \"as is\" into the database for the same reasons as\noutlined above.\n\nBut: we tell you in the services overview whether we'll use TLS to transmit the\nupdate, so at least if TLS is enabled, it won't go unencrypted over the wire.\n\n\nCSRF protection\n===============\n\nWe use Django's CSRF protection middleware.\n\n\nClickjacking protection\n=======================\n\nWe use Django's clickjacking protection middleware.\n\n\nXSS protection\n==============\n\nDjango's templating engine html-escapes inputs by default.\n\n\nCookies\n=======\n\nThe software (\"as is\") uses these cookies:\n\n* \"csrftoken\" (host-only, for CSRF protection)\n* \"sessionid\" (host-only, to keep the session when you have logged-in to the\n  web interface)\n\nIf you have set WE_HAVE_TLS to True (because you run the software on a https\nsite), you should also set *_COOKIE_SECURE to True to avoid the cookies getting\ntransmitted via http.\n\nWe use a session cookie by default (gets cleared when you close the browser).\nIf you check the \"Keep me logged in\" checkbox on the login screen, then we'll\nset a permanent cookie with a lifetime as configured by the site admin\n(SESSION_COOKIE_AGE, default: 14 days).\n\nBe careful with domain cookies\n------------------------------\n\nThe software (\"as is\") does not use any domain cookies.\n\nIn case you modify the software, please be extremely cautious with domain\ncookies and in case of doubt, do rather not use them.\n\nIf you use domain cookies (like for \".yourservice.net\", the leading dot\nmakes it a domain cookie), all hosts in that domain would be able to read\nand write these cookies. Your site (at e.g. www.yourservice.net), but also\nusers' sites (like attacker.yourservice.net).\n\nObviously, this might lead to security issues with stealing, modifying and\nfaking domain cookies.\n\n\nDjango's SECRET_KEY\n===================\n\nDjango's SECRET_KEY needs to be a long, random and secret string (it is\nusually set up by the administrator of the site).\n\nThe builtin default settings will try to read SECRET_KEY from an environment\nvariable of same name. If there is no such environment variable, the SECRET_KEY\nwill be undefined.\n\nYou can also define the SECRET_KEY in your local_settings.py.\n\nIf you do not define a SECRET_KEY by one of these methods, the application\nwill refuse to start and give you an error, that a SECRET_KEY is required.\n",

The only critical thing is that your domain provider is willing to add the DS records to the top level domain.\n\nFor my zone I have the following config for DNSSEC with nsupdate:\n\n```\nzone \"stratum0.net\" {\n        auto-dnssec maintain;\n        type master;\n        update-policy {\n                  ....\n        };\n        file \"/etc/bind/stratum0.net/stratum0.net\";\n        key-directory \"/etc/bind/stratum0.net\";\n};\n```\n\nOnly auto-dnssec maintain and key-directory \"/etc/bind/stratum0.net\" are relevant to DNSSEC. With this setup, you only need to use dnssec-keygen to generate the KSK and ZSK. Finally you generate the DS records with dnssec-dsfromkey -f <zonefile> and pass those to your domain provider. There is a short guide at http://fanf.livejournal.com/112476.html.\n\nIf your domain provider doesn't support DNSSEC, you can use [DLV (DNSSEC Look-aside Validation)](https://dlv.isc.org/). It's an alternative entry point and also very useful for initial testing.\n\nAlso very useful for debugging is http://dnsviz.net/d/stratum0.net/dnssec/, which shows you a graph of all keys and their relationships. The gray DNSKEYs are KSKs and the while ones are ZSKs. To keep DNS messages smaller, DNSSEC uses shorter keys and so they must be rotated regularly. The longer (2048 bit) KSKs have a lifetime on the order of years and the shorter (1024 bit) ZSKs on the order of months. Note that they do not expire after this time, it's just strongly recommended to perform a rollover after that time.\n\nWith auto-dnssec maintain, you just have to generate new keys. The metadata in the key files allows BIND to handle the rollover automatically. For KSK changes, you'd need to notify your domain provider again.\n\nThis setup has been running without problems for since two months on stratum0.net (which provides DYNDNS for our hackerspace).\n",

There is a short guide at http://fanf.livejournal.com/112476.html.\n\nIf your domain provider doesn't support DNSSEC, you can use [DLV (DNSSEC Look-aside Validation)](https://dlv.isc.org/). It's an alternative entry point and also very useful for initial testing.\n\nAlso very useful for debugging is http://dnsviz.net/d/stratum0.net/dnssec/, which shows you a graph of all keys and their relationships. The gray DNSKEYs are KSKs and the while ones are ZSKs. To keep DNS messages smaller, DNSSEC uses shorter keys and so they must be rotated regularly. The longer (2048 bit) KSKs have a lifetime on the order of years and the shorter (1024 bit) ZSKs on the order of months. Note that they do not expire after this time, it's just strongly recommended to perform a rollover after that time.\n\nWith auto-dnssec maintain, you just have to generate new keys. The metadata in the key files allows BIND to handle the rollover automatically. For KSK changes, you'd need to notify your domain provider again.\n\nThis setup has been running without problems for since two months on stratum0.net (which provides DYNDNS for our hackerspace).\n",

This is because airflow [forgot to pin `authlib`](https://github.com/apache/airflow/commit/6d7fa874ff201af7f602be9c58a827998814bdd1#diff-60f61ab7a8d1910d86d9fda2261620314edcae5894d5aaa236b821c7256badd7R274) to the same versions as `Flask-AppBuilder`, so the latest `authlib` is always installed with airflow.\r\n\r\n@potiuk you may want to look at that!\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThe main issues I see from people who have already tried to use 1.0.1, are related to `jwks_uri` not being set (rather than any actual issue with Flask-AppBuilder). \r\n\r\nThe error text is: `Error authorizing OAuth access token: Missing \"jwks_uri\" in metadata`, see related issues:\r\n- https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13948#issuecomment-856981962\r\n- https://github.com/dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder/issues/1821\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72035617/runtimeerror-missing-jwks-uri-in-metadata-for-flask-and-azure-ad-authlib\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCurrently, all of our [OAUTH security examples](https://flask-appbuilder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/security.html#authentication-oauth) don't show setting `jwks_uri` which is [now required](https://docs.authlib.org/en/latest/client/frameworks.html#parsing-id-token) when using `id_token` auth.\r\nWe need to update our examples to set `jwks_uri` so they continue to work with `authlib` 1.0.1.\r\n\r\n__Example for Google with `jwks_url`:__\r\n\r\n```python\r\nOAUTH_PROVIDERS = [\r\n    {\r\n        \"name\": \"google\",\r\n        \"icon\": \"fa-google\",\r\n        \"token_key\": \"access_token\",\r\n        \"remote_app\": {\r\n            \"client_id\": \"GOOGLE_KEY\",\r\n            \"client_secret\": \"GOOGLE_SECRET\",\r\n            \"api_base_url\": \"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v2/\",\r\n            \"client_kwargs\": {\"scope\": \"email profile\"},\r\n            \"access_token_url\": \"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token\",\r\n            \"authorize_url\": \"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth\",\r\n            \"jwks_uri\": \"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/certs\",\r\n        },\r\n    },\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWe may also want to show setting `server_metadata_url` to an OpenID `/.well-known/openid-configuration` URL, (which replaces the need to set `authorize_url`, `access_token_url`, and `jwks_uri` so is a bit easier for people).\r\n\r\n__Example for Google with `server_metadata_url`:__\r\n\r\n```python\r\nOAUTH_PROVIDERS = [\r\n    {\r\n        \"name\": \"google\",\r\n        \"icon\": \"fa-google\",\r\n        \"token_key\": \"access_token\",\r\n        \"remote_app\": {\r\n            \"client_id\": \"GOOGLE_KEY\",\r\n            \"client_secret\": \"GOOGLE_SECRET\",\r\n            \"api_base_url\": \"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v2/\",\r\n            \"server_metadata_url\": \"https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration\",\r\n            \"client_kwargs\": {\"scope\": \"email profile\"},\r\n        },\r\n    },\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n__Example for Okta with `sever_metadata_url`:__\r\n\r\n```python\r\nOAUTH_PROVIDERS = [\r\n  {\r\n      \"name\": \"okta\",\r\n      \"icon\": \"fa-circle-o\",\r\n      \"token_key\": \"access_token\",\r\n      \"remote_app\": {\r\n          \"client_id\": \"OKTA_KEY\",\r\n          \"client_secret\": \"OKTA_SECRET\",\r\n          \"api_base_url\": \"https://OKTA_DOMAIN.okta.com/oauth2/v1/\",\r\n          \"server_metadata_url\": \"https://OKTA_DOMAIN.okta.com/.well-known/openid-configuration\",\r\n          \"client_kwargs\": {\"scope\": \"openid profile email groups\"},\r\n      },\r\n  },\r\n]\r\n```",

We should use \"flask-app-builder[oauth]\" as dependency there so that we do not have to manually sync dependencies when FAB updates it.\r\n\r\nBTW. We have just started to migrate to FAB 4.0 @thesuperzapper - you might want to join our crew of people who will help with testing it (there are many breaking changes in the underlying libraries). I've added you so to that you are aware and possibly help us with testing Airfflow  https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/22397#issuecomment-1156603972 \r\n\r\nIn the meantime - indeed upgrading of the authlib in FAB 4.1.2 might be a good idea indeed (and once we use oauth extra, airflow deps will update automatically) \r\n",

After spending half a day trying to find a solution, all what's really needed is to add `libldap-common` to the docker image and Airflow starts working again with LDAP just fine.\r\n \r\nSo, hopefully this will help you and someone else in the future!",

Where in fact `upn` is not present on the `id_token` but `email` is, so it probably makes more sense to use this field (config would need to change to include the email option claim), and a fall back to construct a unique email based on the username has a best effort and to preserve uniqueness.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand `given_name` and `family_name` belong to the `access_token` claims. \r\n\r\nNot an expert on Azure AD, but `id_token` is more compliant to OpenID OAuth and `access_token` seems more Azure proprietary is this a right assumption @melazarus ?\r\n",

For example:\n>\n> ```sh\n> mkdir ~/fides\n> cd ~/fides\n> python3 -m venv venv\n> source venv/bin/activate\n> ```\n\nOnce your virtual environment is ready, you can easily download and install Fides using `pip`. Run the following command to get started:\n\n```\npip install ethyca-fides\n```\n\n#### Deploy the Fides sample project\n\nBy default, Fides ships with a small project belonging to a fictional e-commerce store. Running the `fides deploy up` command builds a Fides project with all you need to run your first Data Subject Request against real databases.\n\n```sh\nfides deploy up\n```\n\n#### Explore the sample project\n\nWhen your deployment finishes, a welcome screen will explain the key components of Fides and the sample \"Cookie House\" project.\n\nIf your browser does not open automatically, you should navigate to <http://localhost:3000/landing>.\n\nThe project contains:\n\n* The Fides Admin UI for managing privacy requests\n* The Fides [Privacy Center](https://ethyca.com/docs/dev-docs/privacy-requests/privacy-center) for submitting requests\n* The sample \"Cookie House\" eCommerce site for testing\n* A DSR Directory on your computer to view results (`./fides_uploads`)\n\n#### Run your first Privacy Access Request\n\nNavigate to the Fides Privacy Center (<http://localhost:3001>), submit a \"Download your data\" request, provide the email address for the sample user (`jane@example.com`), and submit the request.\n\nThen, navigate to the Fides Admin UI (<http://localhost:8080>) to review the pending privacy request.\n\nUse username `root_user` and password `Testpassword1!` to login, approve the request, and review the resulting package in your `./fides_uploads` folder!\n\n### Next Steps\n\nCongratulations! You've just run an entire privacy request in under 5 minutes! Fides offers many more tools to help take control of your data privacy. To find out more, you can run a privacy request on [your own infrastructure](https://ethyca.com/docs/tutorials/privacy-requests), discover [data mapping](https://ethyca.com/docs/tutorials/data-mapping), or learn about the [Fides Taxonomy](https://ethyca.github.io/fideslang/).\n\n## :book: Learn More\n\nThe Fides core team is committed to providing a variety of documentation to help get you started using Fides.

However, if you *do* want to connect to MSSQL, you have two options:\n1. Use our pre-built Docker images which install these optional dependencies automatically: [`ethyca/fides`](https://hub.docker.com/r/ethyca/fides). See our [Deployment Guide](https://ethyca.com/docs/dev-docs/configuration/deployment) for more!\n2. Install the required dependencies on your local development machine and run `pip install \"ethyca-fides[all]\"` to include \"all\" the optional libraries. Keep reading to learn more about this!\n\nFor local development setup on macOS, follow these steps:\n1. Install the required development libraries from Homebrew:\n```bash\nbrew install freetds openssl\n```\n2. Add the following to your shell (i.e. `.zshrc`) to ensure your compiler can access the `freetds` and `openssl` libraries, updating the paths & versions to match your local install:\n```bash\nexport LDFLAGS=\"-L/opt/homebrew/Cellar/freetds/1.3.18/lib -L/opt/homebrew/Cellar/openssl@1.1/1.1.1u/lib\"\nexport CFLAGS=\"-I/opt/homebrew/Cellar/freetds/1.3.18/include\"\n```\n3. Reinstall Fides with MSSQL support by including the `all` extra requirement:\n```bash\npip install ethyca-fides[all]\n```\n",

There is a separate PR for handling migrations for current users, as they are both sufficiently complex pieces to warrant handling separately.\r\n\r\nMuch of the inspiration/work here is inspired by [this PR](https://github.com/ethyca/fides/pull/3343) that handled an earlier, similar change\r\n\r\nThe Data Migration work is happening here: #4030\r\n\r\n_*WARNING: Merging this change as-is will break any existing instance due to default taxonomy model conflicts*_\r\n\r\n### Code Changes\r\n\r\n* [x] bump `requirements.txt`\r\n* [x] add a migration for the new `version` fields\r\n* Update `DataCategories`\r\n  * [x] datasets (including collections/fields)\r\n  * [x] policy rule **(tested previously, code is copy/pasta)**\r\n  * [x] privacy declaration **(tested previously, code is copy/pasta)**\r\n  * [x] data flows (egress and ingress on `System` models)\r\n* Update `DataUse`s\r\n  * [x] privacy declaration **(tested previously, code is copy/pasta)**\r\n  * [x] policy rule **(tested previously, code is copy/pasta)**\r\n* [x] do find/replace for the old categories/uses\r\n\r\n### Steps to Confirm\r\n\r\nBecause this PR is focused on getting _new_ instances working instead of migrating data, the `Steps to Confirm` here are very simple. Tests passing is what we care about here! [This PR](https://github.com/ethyca/fides/pull/4030) is where the complex data migration will take place\r\n\r\n* [ ] after running `nox -s teardown -- volumes` and `nox -s dev`, everything works as intended\r\n\r\n### Pre-Merge Checklist\r\n\r\n* [ ] All CI Pipelines Succeeded\r\n* Documentation:\r\n  * [ ] documentation complete, [PR opened in fidesdocs](https://github.com/ethyca/fidesdocs/pulls)\r\n  * [ ] documentation [issue created in fidesdocs](https://github.com/ethyca/fidesdocs/issues/new/choose)\r\n* [ ] Issue Requirements are Met\r\n* [ ] Relevant Follow-Up Issues Created\r\n* [ ] Update `CHANGELOG.md`\r\n* [ ] For API changes, the [Postman collection](https://github.com/ethyca/fides/blob/main/docs/fides/docs/development/postman/Fides.postman_collection.json) has been updated\r\n",

The TS models are generally updated by running `npm run openapi:generate` in `clients/admin-ui` against fidesplus. If that doesn't have any changes, then we should be good to go 👍 (but also it probably will have _some_ changes, as it's probably been a little bit since we last ran it. you can just see if there are any changes directly related to this work)",

The migration was crashing so I added some changes here: https://github.com/ethyca/fides/pull/3933/commits/9308569ad9e9342d9e43256f65a3f9bd266c20cd to move this forward, but there's still more work to do.  Let's all continue to test and figure out where the gaps are.\r\n\r\nHere's some current TODO items I'm seeing after another round of testing:\r\n\r\n- [x] I think this is the biggest potential issue.  Migrate custom data uses and custom data categories that build off of the affected 2.0 uses and categories.   \r\n    -  For example, say I have a custom data use, \"user.search_history.work\" that I am using on a PrivacyDeclaration. We migrate that to \"user.behavior.search_history.work\" on the Declaration.  However, there is no \"DataUse\" that matches, and you get errors later when trying to update the System as a result.   \r\n\r\n- [x] New column `PrivacyDeclaration.shared_categories` going out in the current release needs to be migrated now that this migration has been delayed for a followup release.

Some dependencies must also have their versions updated in `setup.py`. This requires engineers to \"just know\" that the version must be updated in both places, and occasionally it will be forgotten.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nThe `setup.py` file should include a function with a signature like:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfind_requirement(requirements_file: str, dependency_name: str) -> str\r\n```\r\n\r\nthat, when called, will search the provided requirements file and return the line containing the name of the desired dependency.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered, if any\r\n\r\nWe can do nothing, and continue to facepalm when we forget to double-update dependency versions.\n\n",

This type of query isn't smart enough to skip an `UPDATE` if the applied change would result in an otherwise identical record. IOW, if we attempt to `INSERT` a record, and that `INSERT` would result in a database constraint violation, then an `UPDATE` is _always_ performed (even if nothing about the record changes). From the perspective of the code, this is by far the simplest way to achieve an upsert action. From the perspective of the database, this is generally inefficient, and could result in some side-effects.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>What kind of side-effects?</summary>\r\n\r\n- It might fire triggers that should not be fired.\r\n- It write-locks \"innocent\" (unchanging) rows, possibly incurring costs for concurrent transactions.\r\n- It might make the row seem new, even though it's old (transaction timestamp).\r\n- Most importantly, with [PostgreSQL's MVCC model](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/mvcc-intro.html) a new row version is written for every `UPDATE`, regardless of whether the row data changed. This incurs a performance penalty for the `UPSERT` itself, table bloat, index bloat, performance penalty for subsequent operations on the table, and `VACUUM` cost. These effects are minor for queries encountering few duplicates, but massive for queries encountering many duplicates.\r\n\r\nI went ahead with this implementation because none of those drawbacks seem to be applicable to the fidesctl database. We don't use database triggers for anything, we don't have concurrency concerns, we don't care how old records are, and even when upserting the default taxonomy over an already-persisted default taxonomy, the query still runs quickly.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>What could we do differently?</summary>\r\n\r\n**IF** we want to iterate on this approach in the future, we can create a more complex (read: smarter) upsert query like:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nWITH input_rows(columns...) AS (\r\n\tVALUES (value1, value2, ...)\r\n), ins AS (\r\n\tINSERT INTO table_name (columns...) \r\n\tSELECT * FROM input_rows\r\n\tON CONFLICT (targets...) DO NOTHING\r\n\tRETURNING column1, column2, ...\r\n)\r\nSELECT 'i' AS source                           -- 'i' for 'inserted'\r\n     , column1, column2\r\nFROM   ins\r\nUNION  ALL\r\nSELECT 's' AS source                           -- 's' for 'selected'\r\n     , c.column1, c.column2\r\nFROM   input_rows\r\nJOIN   table_name c USING (targets...);\r\n```\r\nbut I wasn't going to be able to build that with sqlalchemy in any reasonable amount of time.\r\n\r\nThe result would be a more efficient upsert action that enables us to skip rows that wouldn't receive any effective update when `ON CONFLICT` is enacted, and return to logging the \"unchanged\" values as we were previously.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n> it looks like we got rid of the `unchanged` list, so now `update` is either `unchanged or updated`?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately no, the `unchanged` list no longer applies because we always `UPDATE` when we don't `INSERT`.\r\n\r\n> I guess diff also only works when its `--dry`?\r\n\r\nThis was not intended, but yes. I think I see a way of enabling `--diff` without also using `--dry`. Gonna try hacking at it for a bit.",

I guess it's worth deciding if we want to 1) accurately represent what `fidesctl apply` is doing under-the-hood or 2) reassure users that nothing is changing when nothing should be changing. Regardless, reverting this change would only lead to \"unchanged\" returning while using `--dry`, since it's not possible to detect unchanged rows during the \"real\" upsert (since all rows are always _technically_ modified).\r\n\r\nPersonally, I prefer the current state of the code, and I would encourage users to use the `--diff` flag to see what's changing.",

There is a separate PR for handling migrations for current users, as they are both sufficiently complex pieces to warrant handling separately.\r\n\r\nMuch of the inspiration/work here is inspired by [this PR](https://github.com/ethyca/fides/pull/3343) that handled an earlier, similar change\r\n\r\nThe Data Migration work is happening here: #4030\r\n\r\n_*WARNING: Merging this change as-is will break any existing instance due to default taxonomy model conflicts*_\r\n\r\n### Code Changes\r\n\r\n* [x] bump `requirements.txt`\r\n* [x] add a migration for the new `version` fields\r\n* Update `DataCategories`\r\n  * [x] datasets (including collections/fields)\r\n  * [x] policy rule **(tested previously, code is copy/pasta)**\r\n  * [x] privacy declaration **(tested previously, code is copy/pasta)**\r\n  * [x] data flows (egress and ingress on `System` models)\r\n* Update `DataUse`s\r\n  * [x] privacy declaration **(tested previously, code is copy/pasta)**\r\n  * [x] policy rule **(tested previously, code is copy/pasta)**\r\n* [x] do find/replace for the old categories/uses\r\n\r\n### Steps to Confirm\r\n\r\nBecause this PR is focused on getting _new_ instances working instead of migrating data, the `Steps to Confirm` here are very simple.

The TS models are generally updated by running `npm run openapi:generate` in `clients/admin-ui` against fidesplus. If that doesn't have any changes, then we should be good to go 👍 (but also it probably will have _some_ changes, as it's probably been a little bit since we last ran it. you can just see if there are any changes directly related to this work)",

The migration was crashing so I added some changes here: https://github.com/ethyca/fides/pull/3933/commits/9308569ad9e9342d9e43256f65a3f9bd266c20cd to move this forward, but there's still more work to do.  Let's all continue to test and figure out where the gaps are.\r\n\r\nHere's some current TODO items I'm seeing after another round of testing:\r\n\r\n- [x] I think this is the biggest potential issue.  Migrate custom data uses and custom data categories that build off of the affected 2.0 uses and categories.   \r\n    -  For example, say I have a custom data use, \"user.search_history.work\" that I am using on a PrivacyDeclaration. We migrate that to \"user.behavior.search_history.work\" on the Declaration.  However, there is no \"DataUse\" that matches, and you get errors later when trying to update the System as a result.   \r\n\r\n- [x] New column `PrivacyDeclaration.shared_categories` going out in the current release needs to be migrated now that this migration has been delayed for a followup release.  Resurfacing [earlier comment](https://github.com/ethyca/fides/pull/3933#discussion_r1305942158)\r\n\r\n- [x] `PrivacyNotice`, `PrivacyNoticeTemplate`, and `PrivacyNoticeHistory` `data_uses` columns likely need to be migrated.  None of our out of the box notices have data uses at risk, but customers could have added custom notices, or added data uses to existing notices. \r\n\r\n- [x] ~Mysterious error on data subjects and sometimes data uses endpoint after running these migrations, usually where we have a data use mismatch somewhere~. As Thomas noted below, this is unrelated to this work\r\n```\r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52 2023-08-31 22:53:52.876 | INFO     | fides.api.main:log_request:150 - Request received | {'method': 'GET', 'status_code': 200, 'handler_time': '25.242ms', 'path': '/api/v1/data_category/'}\r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52 2023-08-31 22:53:52.878 | ERROR    | fides.api.util.logger:_log_exception:31 - unhandled errors in a TaskGroup (1 sub-exception)\r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52 Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52   File \"/opt/fides/lib/python3.10/site-packages/anyio/streams/memory.py\", line 97, in receive\r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52     return self.receive_nowait()\r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52   File \"/opt/fides/lib/python3.10/site-packages/anyio/streams/memory.py\", line 92, in receive_nowait\r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52     raise WouldBlock\r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52 anyio.WouldBlock\r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52 \r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52 During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:\r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52 \r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52 Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52   File \"/opt/fides/lib/python3.10/site-packages/starlette/middleware/base.py\", line 77, in call_next\r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52     message = await recv_stream.receive()\r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52   File \"/opt/fides/lib/python3.10/site-packages/anyio/streams/memory.py\", line 112, in receive\r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52     raise EndOfStream\r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52 anyio.EndOfStream\r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52 Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52   File \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52   File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.10/multiprocessing/spawn.py\", line 116, in spawn_main\r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52     exitcode = _main(fd, parent_sentinel)\r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52   File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.10/multiprocessing/spawn.py\", line 129, in _main\r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52     return self._bootstrap(parent_sentinel)\r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52   File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.10/multiprocessing/process.py\", line 314, in _bootstrap\r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52     self.run()\r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52   File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.10/multiprocessing/process.py\", line 108, in run\r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52     self._target(*self._args, **self._kwargs)\r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52   File \"/opt/fides/lib/python3.10/site-packages/uvicorn/_subprocess.py\", line 76, in subprocess_started\r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52     target(sockets=sockets)\r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52   File \"/opt/fides/lib/python3.10/site-packages/uvicorn/server.py\", line 61, in run\r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52     return asyncio.run(self.serve(sockets=sockets))\r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52   File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.10/asyncio/runners.py\", line 44, in run\r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52     return loop.run_until_complete(main)\r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52   File \"/opt/fides/lib/python3.10/site-packages/starlette/middleware/base.py\", line 69, in coro\r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52     await self.app(scope, receive_or_disconnect, send_no_error)\r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52   File \"/opt/fides/lib/python3.10/site-packages/starlette/middleware/base.py\", line 106, in __call__\r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52     response = await self.dispatch_func(request, call_next)\r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52 > File \"/fides/src/fides/api/main.py\", line 73, in dispatch_log_request\r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52     response = await call_next(request)\r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52   File \"/opt/fides/lib/python3.10/site-packages/starlette/middleware/base.py\", line 80, in call_next\r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52     raise app_exc\r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52   File \"/opt/fides/lib/python3.10/site-packages/starlette/middleware/base.py\", line 69, in coro\r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52     await self.app(scope, receive_or_disconnect, send_no_error)\r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52   File \"/opt/fides/lib/python3.10/site-packages/starlette/middleware/cors.py\", line 84, in __call__\r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52     await self.app(scope, receive, send)\r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52   File \"/opt/fides/lib/python3.10/site-packages/starlette/middleware/base.py\", line 104, in __call__\r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52     async with anyio.create_task_group() as task_group:\r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52   File \"/opt/fides/lib/python3.10/site-packages/anyio/_backends/_asyncio.py\", line 664, in __aexit__\r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52     raise BaseExceptionGroup(\r\n2023-08-31 17:53:52 exceptiongroup.ExceptionGroup: unhandled errors in a TaskGroup (1 sub-exception)\r\n```\r\n",

internal representation, and fairly powerful image processing capabilities.\n\nThe core image library is designed for fast access to data stored in a few basic pixel formats. It should provide a solid foundation for a general image processing tool.\n\n## More Information\n\n- [Documentation](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/)\n  - [Installation](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/basic-installation.html)\n  - [Handbook](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/handbook/index.html)\n- [Contribute](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n  - [Issues](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/issues)\n  - [Pull requests](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/pulls)\n- [Release notes](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/releasenotes/index.html)\n- [Changelog](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/blob/main/CHANGES.rst)\n  - [Pre-fork](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/blob/main/CHANGES.rst#pre-fork)\n\n## Report a Vulnerability\n\nTo report a security vulnerability, please follow the procedure described in the [Tidelift security policy](https://tidelift.com/docs/security).\n",

Please visit `OMERO Python language bindings <https://omero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/developers/Python.html>`_ for a list of supported platforms and Python versions.\n\nWhen the wheel is installed, activate the virtual environment and install ``omero-web`` from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/>`_.\n\n::\n\n    $  pip install -U omero-web\n\nSetting of the environment variable ``OMERODIR`` is required.\n``$OMERODIR/var/log/`` directory will contain log files.\n``$OMERODIR/etc/grid/config.xml`` is used to store config::\n\n    $ export OMERODIR=$(pwd)\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nFor running omero-web in production with NGINX, see See: `OMERO.web install`_ documentation.\nTo run in development mode, see below.\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nSee: `OMERO`_ documentation\n\nDeveloper installation\n----------------------\n\nFor a development installation we recommend creating a virtual environment as described above.\nThen install OMERO.web into your virtual environment as an editable package, so that any edits\nto source files will be reflected in your installation.\n\n::\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/ome/omero-web\n    $ cd omero-web\n    $ pip install -e .\n\nNote some ``omero-web`` tests may not run when this module and/or ``omero-py`` are installed in editable mode.\n\nConfiguration for developer usage::\n\n    $ omero config set omero.web.debug True\n    $ omero config set omero.web.application_server development\n\n    # If you want to connect to OMERO.server other than 'localhost'\n    $ omero config append omero.web.server_list '[\"demo.openmicroscopy.org\", 4064, \"demo\"]'\n\nThen run omero-web in the foreground with::\n\n    $ omero web start\n    ...\n    Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:4080/\n\nOr, run Django directly::\n\n    $ cd omero-web\n    $ python omeroweb/manage.py runserver 4080\n    ...\n    Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:4080/\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n\nPlugin developers should review the `Upgrading <UPGRADING.md>`_\ndocument highlighting steps that may need to be taken\nwhen upgrading OMERO.web to ensure plugins or other customizations\ncontinue to function as expected.\n\nRunning tests\n-------------\n\nUnit tests are located under the `test` directory and can be run with pytest.\n\nIntegration tests\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nIntegration tests are stored in the main repository (ome/openmicroscopy) and depend on the\nOMERO integration testing framework. Reading about `Running and writing tests`_ in the `OMERO`_ documentation\nis essential.\n\nRelease process\n---------------\n\nThis repository uses `bump2version <https://pypi.org/project/bump2version/>`_ to manage version numbers.\nTo tag a release run::\n\n    $ bumpversion release\n\nThis will remove the ``.dev0`` suffix from the current version, commit, and tag the release.\n\nTo switch back to a development version run::\n\n    $ bumpversion --no-tag patch\n\nNB: this assumes next release will be a ``patch`` (see below).\nTo complete the release, push the master branch and the release tag to origin::\n\n    $ git push origin master v5.8.0\n\nIf any PRs are merged that would require the next release to be a ``major`` or ``minor`` version\n(see `semver.org <https://semver.org/>`_) then that PR can include a version bump created via::\n\n    $ bumpversion --no-tag minor|major\n\nIf this hasn't been performed prior to release and you wish to specify the next version\nnumber directly when creating the release, this can be achieved with::\n\n    $ bumpversion --new-version 5.9.0 release\n\nomero-web-docker\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nFollowing ``omero-web`` release, need to update and release ``omero-web-docker``.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nOMERO.web is released under the AGPL.\n\nCopyright\n---------\n\n2009-2024, The Open Microscopy Environment, Glencoe Software, Inc.\n\n.. _OMERO: https://www.openmicroscopy.org/omero\n.. _OMERO.web install: https://omero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/sysadmins/unix/install-web/web-deployment.html\n.. _OMERO.py: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/omero-py\n.. _ZeroC IcePy: https://zeroc.com/downloads/ice/3.6\n.. _Pillow: https://python-pillow.org/\n.. _NumPy: http://matplotlib.org/\n.. _Running and writing tests: https://omero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/omero/developers/testing.html\n",

We appreciate efforts to improve the security of MLflow\nand follow the [GitHub coordinated disclosure of security vulnerabilities](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/about-coordinated-disclosure-of-security-vulnerabilities#about-reporting-and-disclosing-vulnerabilities-in-projects-on-github)\nfor responsible disclosure and prompt mitigation. We are committed to working with security researchers to\nresolve the vulnerabilities they discover.\n\n## Supported Versions\n\nThe latest version of MLflow has continued support. If a critical vulnerability is found in the current version\nof MLflow, we may opt to backport patches to previous versions.\n\n## Reporting a Vulnerability\n\nWhen finding a security vulnerability in MLflow, please perform the following actions:\n\n- [Open an issue](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report_template.md&title=%5BBUG%5D%20Security%20Vulnerability) on the MLflow repository. Ensure that you use `[BUG] Security Vulnerability` as the title and _do not_ mention any vulnerability details in the issue post.\n- Send a notification [email](mailto:mlflow-oss-maintainers@googlegroups.com) to `mlflow-oss-maintainers@googlegroups.com` that contains, at a minimum:\n  - The link to the filed issue stub.\n  - Your GitHub handle.\n  - Detailed information about the security vulnerability, evidence that supports the relevance of the finding and any reproducibility instructions for independent confirmation.\n\nThis first stage of reporting is to ensure that a rapid validation can occur without wasting the time and effort of a reporter. Future communication and vulnerability resolution will be conducted after validating\nthe veracity of the reported issue.\n\nAn MLflow maintainer will, after validating the report:\n\n- Acknowledge the [bug](ISSUE_POLICY.md#bug-reports) during [triage](ISSUE_TRIAGE.rst)\n- Mark the issue as `priority/critical-urgent`\n- Open a draft [GitHub Security Advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/creating-a-security-advisory)\n  to discuss the vulnerability details in private.\n\nThe private Security Advisory will be used to confirm the issue, prepare a fix, and publicly disclose it after the fix has been released.\n",

MLflow offers a set of lightweight APIs that can be\nused with any existing machine learning application or library (TensorFlow, PyTorch, XGBoost, etc), wherever you\ncurrently run ML code (e.g. in notebooks, standalone applications or the cloud). MLflow's current components are:\n\n* `MLflow Tracking <https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html>`_: An API to log parameters, code, and\n  results in machine learning experiments and compare them using an interactive UI.\n* `MLflow Projects <https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/projects.html>`_: A code packaging format for reproducible\n  runs using Conda and Docker, so you can share your ML code with others.\n* `MLflow Models <https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html>`_: A model packaging format and tools that let\n  you easily deploy the same model (from any ML library) to batch and real-time scoring on platforms such as\n  Docker, Apache Spark, Azure ML and AWS SageMaker.\n* `MLflow Model Registry <https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/model-registry.html>`_: A centralized model store, set of APIs, and UI, to collaboratively manage the full lifecycle of MLflow Models.\n\n|docs| |license| |downloads| |slack| |twitter|\n\n.. |docs| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-latest-success.svg?style=for-the-badge\n    :target: https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html\n    :alt: Latest Docs\n.. |license| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%202-brightgreen.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=apache\n    :target: https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/LICENSE.txt\n    :alt: Apache 2 License\n.. |downloads| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/dw/mlflow?style=for-the-badge&logo=pypi&logoColor=white\n    :target: https://pepy.tech/project/mlflow\n    :alt: Total Downloads\n.. |slack| image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/slack-@mlflow--users-CF0E5B.svg?logo=slack&logoColor=white&labelColor=3F0E40&style=for-the-badge\n    :target: `Slack`_\n    :alt: Slack\n.. |twitter| image:: https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/MLflow?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=00ACEE&logo=twitter&logoColor=white\n    :target: https://twitter.com/MLflow\n    :alt: Account Twitter\n\nPackages\n\n+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+\n| PyPI          | |pypi-mlflow| |pypi-skinny|                                 |\n+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+\n| conda-forge   | |conda-mlflow| |conda-skinny|                               |\n+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+\n| CRAN          | |cran-mlflow|                                               |\n+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Maven Central | |maven-client| |maven-parent| |maven-scoring| |maven-spark| |\n+---------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n.. |pypi-mlflow| image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/mlflow.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=pypi&logoColor=white&label=mlflow\n    :target: https://pypi.org/project/mlflow/\n    :alt: PyPI -

We are\nseeking contributions to all of our roadmap items with the ``help wanted`` label. Please see the\n`Contributing`_ section for more information.\n\nCommunity\n---------\nFor help or questions about MLflow usage (e.g. \"how do I do X?\") see the `docs <https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html>`_\nor `Stack Overflow <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow>`_.\n\nTo report a bug, file a documentation issue, or submit a feature request, please open a GitHub issue.\n\nFor release announcements and other discussions, please subscribe to our mailing list (mlflow-users@googlegroups.com)\nor join us on `Slack`_.\n\nRunning a Sample App With the Tracking API\n------------------------------------------\nThe programs in ``examples`` use the MLflow Tracking API. For instance, run::\n\n    python examples/quickstart/mlflow_tracking.py\n\nThis program will use `MLflow Tracking API <https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html>`_,\nwhich logs tracking data in ``./mlruns``. This can then be viewed with the Tracking UI.\n\n\nLaunching the Tracking UI\n-------------------------\nThe MLflow Tracking UI will show runs logged in ``./mlruns`` at `<http://localhost:5000>`_.\nStart it with::\n\n    mlflow ui\n\n**Note:** Running ``mlflow ui`` from within a clone of MLflow is not recommended - doing so will\nrun the dev UI from source. We recommend running the UI from a different working directory,\nspecifying a backend store via the ``--backend-store-uri`` option. Alternatively, see\ninstructions for running the dev UI in the `contributor guide <CONTRIBUTING.md>`_.\n\n\nRunning a Project from a URI\n----------------------------\nThe ``mlflow run`` command lets you run a project packaged with a MLproject file from a local path\nor a Git URI::\n\n    mlflow run examples/sklearn_elasticnet_wine -P alpha=0.4\n\n    mlflow run https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow-example.git -P alpha=0.4\n\nSee ``examples/sklearn_elasticnet_wine`` for a sample project with an MLproject file.\n\n\nSaving and Serving Models\n-------------------------\nTo illustrate managing models, the ``mlflow.sklearn`` package can log scikit-learn models as\nMLflow artifacts and then load them again for serving. There is an example training application in\n``examples/sklearn_logistic_regression/train.py`` that you can run as follows::\n\n    $ python examples/sklearn_logistic_regression/train.py\n    Score: 0.666\n    Model saved in run <run-id>\n\n    $ mlflow models serve --model-uri runs:/<run-id>/model\n\n    $ curl -d '{\"dataframe_split\": {\"columns\":[0],\"index\":[0,1],\"data\":[[1],[-1]]}}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  localhost:5000/invocations\n\n**Note:** If using MLflow skinny (``pip install mlflow-skinny``) for model serving, additional\nrequired dependencies (namely, ``flask``) will need to be installed for the MLflow server to function.\n\nOfficial MLflow Docker Image\n----------------------------\n\nThe official MLflow Docker image is available on GitHub Container Registry at https://ghcr.io/mlflow/mlflow.\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    export CR_PAT=YOUR_TOKEN\n    echo $CR_PAT | docker login ghcr.io -u USERNAME --password-stdin\n    # Pull the latest version\n    docker pull ghcr.io/mlflow/mlflow\n    # Pull 2.2.1\n    docker pull ghcr.io/mlflow/mlflow:v2.2.1\n\nContributing\n------------\nWe happily welcome contributions to MLflow. We are also seeking contributions to items on the\n`MLflow Roadmap <https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/milestone/3>`_. Please see our\n`contribution guide <CONTRIBUTING.md>`_ to learn more about contributing to MLflow.\n\nCore Members\n------------\n\nMLflow is currently maintained by the following core members with significant contributions from hundreds of exceptionally talented community members.\n\n- `Ben Wilson <https://github.com/BenWilson2>`_\n- `Corey Zumar <https://github.com/dbczumar>`_\n- `Daniel Lok <https://github.com/daniellok-db>`_\n- `Gabriel Fu <https://github.com/gabrielfu>`_\n- `Harutaka Kawamura <https://github.com/harupy>`_\n- `Serena Ruan <https://github.com/serena-ruan>`_\n- `Weichen Xu <https://github.com/WeichenXu123>`_\n- `Yuki Watanabe <https://github.com/B-Step62>`_\n",

We plan to do more than simply replicate the functionalities of the legacy TAK server, our road map includes integration with open source systems like LORA's Meshtastic, porting it to Android, having an open API, and much more.\n\nWe are doing it for free because we believe that donating personal time to a cause is an endeavour that is worthy per-se, However, we are also spending our own time and money to:\n\n- Maintain a Public server and a test server\n- Invest in different technologies for R&D\n\nIf you feel that FTS is useful to you and you can donate in those challenging times please consider contributing here:\n[DONATE](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=brothercorvo%40gmail.com&item_name=FreeTAKServer+R%26D&currency_code=CAD&source=url)\n\nYou can also support the project by buying one of our [t-shirts](http://tee.pub/lic/elARpZYCmaw).\n\n**_NOTE_**:\n\n> Not a big fan of Paypal, but that is the easiest way I found for an initial attempt. We may go to some more ethical system in future.\n> Finally you can help the project by spamming FTS information, starring our repositories in github and Pip and upvoting us.\n\n[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=FreeTAKTeam/FreeTakServer,tkuester/taky,TAK-Product-Center/Server&type=Date)](https://star-history.com/#FreeTAKTeam/FreeTakServer&tkuester/taky&TAK-Product-Center/Server&Date)\n\n## Open Source Notes\n\nFTS was made possible by the following Open Source projects.\nWe'd like to thank the following individuals and organizations for providing crucial support and making FTS possible.\n\n- [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/)\n- [lxml](https://lxml.de/)\n- [pathlib](https://pathlib.readthedocs.io/en/pep428/)\n- [tabulate](https://pypi.org/project/tabulate/)\n- [sqlalchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)\n- [setuptools](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/)\n- [eventlet](https://eventlet.net/)\n- [random_word](https://pypi.org/project/Random-Word/)\n- [Pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)\n- [Bootstrap4](https://getbootstrap.com/)\n- [pyopenssl](https://pypi.org/project/pyOpenSSL/)\n- [Flask Dashboard Black by AppSeed](https://github.com/app-generator/flask-black-dashboard)\n",

It's simple, efficient, and easy to use.\n\nDocumentation: https://json2xml.readthedocs.io.\n\nThe library was initially dependent on the `dict2xml` project, but it has now been integrated into json2xml itself. This has led to cleaner code, the addition of types and tests, and overall improved performance.\n\nFeatures\n^^^^^^^^\n\njson2xml supports the following features:\n\n* Conversion from a `json` string to XML\n* Conversion from a `json` file to XML\n* Conversion from an API that emits `json` data to XML\n\nUsage\n^^^^^\n\nYou can use the json2xml library in the following ways:\n\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from json2xml import json2xml\n    from json2xml.utils import readfromurl, readfromstring, readfromjson\n\n    # Convert JSON data from a URL to XML\n    data = readfromurl(\"https://api.publicapis.org/entries\")\n    print(json2xml.Json2xml(data).to_xml())\n\n    # Convert a JSON string to XML\n    data = readfromstring(\n        '{\"login\":\"mojombo\",\"id\":1,\"avatar_url\":\"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1?v=4\"}'\n    )\n    print(json2xml.Json2xml(data).to_xml())\n\n    # Convert a JSON file to XML\n    data = readfromjson(\"examples/licht.json\")\n    print(json2xml.Json2xml(data).to_xml())\n\n\nCustom Wrappers and Indentation\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nBy default, a wrapper `all` and pretty `True` is set. However, you can easily change this in your code like this:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from json2xml import json2xml\n    from json2xml.utils import readfromurl, readfromstring, readfromjson\n\n    data = readfromstring(\n        '{\"login\":\"mojombo\",\"id\":1,\"avatar_url\":\"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1?v=4\"}'\n    )\n    print(json2xml.Json2xml(data, wrapper=\"all\", pretty=True).to_xml())\n\n\nOutputs this:\n\n.. code-block:: xml\n\n    <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n    <all>\n      <login type=\"str\">mojombo</login>\n      <id type=\"int\">1</id>\n      <avatar_url type=\"str\">https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1?v=4</avatar_url>\n    </all>\n\nOmit List item\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nAssume the following json input\n\n.. code-block:: json\n\n    {\n      \"my_items\": [\n        { \"my_item\": { \"id\": 1 } },\n        { \"my_item\": { \"id\": 2 } }\n      ],\n      \"my_str_items\": [\"a\", \"b\"]\n    }\n\nBy default, items in an array are wrapped in <item></item>.\n\nDefault output:\n\n.. code-block:: xml\n\n    <?xml version=\"1.0\" ?>\n    <all>\n      <my_items type=\"list\">\n        <item type=\"dict\">\n          <my_item type=\"dict\">\n            <id type=\"int\">1</id>\n          </my_item>\n        </item>\n        <item type=\"dict\">\n          <my_item type=\"dict\">\n            <id type=\"int\">2</id>\n          </my_item>\n        </item>\n      </my_items>\n      <my_str_items type=\"list\">\n        <item type=\"str\">a</item>\n        <item type=\"str\">b</item>\n      </my_str_items>\n      <empty type=\"list\"/>\n    </all>\n\nHowever, you can change this behavior using the item_wrap property like this:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from json2xml import json2xml\n    from json2xml.utils import readfromurl, readfromstring, readfromjson\n\n    data = readfromstring('{\"my_items\":[{\"my_item\":{\"id\":1} },{\"my_item\":{\"id\":2} }],\"my_str_items\":[\"a\",\"b\"]}')\n    print(json2xml.Json2xml(data, item_wrap=False).to_xml())\n\nOutputs this:\n\n.. code-block:: xml\n\n    <?xml version=\"1.0\" ?>\n    <all>\n      <my_items type=\"list\">\n        <my_item type=\"dict\">\n          <id type=\"int\">1</id>\n        </my_item>\n        <my_item type=\"dict\">\n          <id type=\"int\">2</id>\n        </my_item>\n      </my_items>\n      <my_str_items type=\"str\">a</my_str_items>\n      <my_str_items type=\"str\">b</my_str_items>\n    </all>\n\nOptional Attribute Type Support\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nYou can also specify if the output XML needs to have type specified or not. Here is the usage:\n\n .. code-block:: python\n\n    from json2xml import json2xml\n    from json2xml.utils import readfromurl, readfromstring, readfromjson\n\n    data = readfromstring(\n        '{\"login\":\"mojombo\",\"id\":1,\"avatar_url\":\"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1?v=4\"}'\n    )\n    print(json2xml.Json2xml(data, wrapper=\"all\", pretty=True, attr_type=False).to_xml())\n\n\nOutputs this:\n\n.. code-block:: xml\n\n    <?xml version=\"1.0\" ?>\n    <all>\n      <login>mojombo</login>\n      <id>1</id>\n      <avatar_url>https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1?v=4</avatar_url>\n    </all>\n\n\nThe methods are simple and easy to use and there are also checks inside of code to exit cleanly\nin case any of the input(file, string or API URL) returns invalid JSON.\n\nHow to run tests\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThis is provided by pytest, which is straight forward.\n\n .. code-block:: console\n\n    virtualenv venv -p $(which python3.9)\n    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt\n    python setup.py install\n    pytest -vv\n\n\nHelp and Support to maintain this project\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n- You can sponsor my work for this plugin here: https://github.com/sponsors/vinitkumar/\n\n",

See our [2023 blog post](https://blog.includesecurity.com/2023/03/mitigating-ssrf-in-2023/) for more details.**\r\n\r\n### Ported by [@nicolasrod](https://github.com/nicolasrod) and docs by [@momopranto](https://github.com/momopranto)\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\nSafeURL is a library that aids developers in protecting against a class of vulnerabilities known as [Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](http://www.acunetix.com/blog/articles/server-side-request-forgery-vulnerability/). It does this by validating each part of the URL against a configurable white or black list before making an HTTP request. SafeURL is open-source and licensed under MIT.\r\n\r\nNote that for mitigating SSRF vulnerabilities, we first recommend routing outbound requests from your infrastructure through a proxy such as [Smokescreen](https://github.com/stripe/smokescreen). Alternately, ensure that all services which can make outbound requests to potentially user-controlled URLs are firewalled from talking to other internal hosts. Application-layer defences such as this library should only be used if those options are not practical. Please see [our blog post](https://blog.includesecurity.com/2023/03/mitigating-ssrf-in-2023/) for further information.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nClone this repository and import it into your project.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\nSafeURL serves as a replacement wrapper for [PyCurl](http://pycurl.io/) in Python.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntry:\r\n  #User controlled input\r\n  url = request.args['url']\r\n  su = safeurl.SafeURL()\r\n  #Execute using SafeURL\r\n  res = su.execute(url)\r\nexcept:\r\n  print \"Unexpected error:\", sys.exc_info()\r\n  #URL wasn't safe\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\nOptions such as white and black lists can be modified. For example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntry:\r\n    su = safeurl.SafeURL()\r\n    #Create an options object\r\n    opt = safeurl.Options()\r\n    opt.clearList(\"whitelist\")\r\n    opt.clearList(\"blacklist\")\r\n    #Allow requests to specific domains\r\n    opt.setList(\"whitelist\", [\"google.com\", \"youtube.com\"], \"domain\")\r\n    #Restrict urls with the ftp scheme\r\n    opt.setList(\"blacklist\",[\"ftp\"],\"scheme\")\r\n\r\n    su.setOptions(opt)\r\n    res = su.execute(\"http://www.youtube.com\")\r\nexcept:\r\n    print \"Unexpected error:\", sys.exc_info()\r\n```\r\n",

It also makes it possible to dynamically create mailbox platforms (needed in case CDR isn't supplied by the server).  Additionally, mailboxes without media are now supported, as are read-only messages, making the mailbox platform more generic.  Lastly all asycio.coroutines have been migrated to async/await.\r\nThis pull request requires a matching frontend change\r\n\r\n**Pull request in [home-assistant.github.io](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant.github.io) with documentation (if applicable): https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant.io/pull/6264**\r\n**Pull request in [home-assistant-polymer](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant-polymer) for frontend updates: https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant-polymer/pull/1660**\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n  - [x] The code change is tested and works locally.\r\n  - [x] Local tests pass with `tox`. **Your PR cannot be merged unless tests pass**\r\n\r\nIf user exposed functionality or configuration variables are added/changed:\r\n  - [x] Documentation added/updated in [home-assistant.github.io](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant.github.io)\r\n\r\nIf the code communicates with devices, web services, or third-party tools:\r\n  - [x] New files were added to `.coveragerc`.\r\n\r\n",

It is written in pure Python and\nruns on Python 3.\n\nWBEM is a standardized approach for systems management defined by the\n[DMTF](https://www.dmtf.org) that is used in the industry for a wide\nvariety of systems management tasks. See [WBEM\nStandards](https://www.dmtf.org/standards/wbem) for more information. An\nimportant use of this approach is the\n[SMI-S](https://www.snia.org/tech_activities/standards/curr_standards/smi)\nstandard defined by [SNIA](https://www.snia.org) for managing storage.\n\n# Functionality\n\nThe major components of pywbem are shown in this diagram:\n\n![pywbem components](images/pywbemcomponents.png)\n\nThe green components all have Python APIs for use by user applications.\nThe yellow components are command line utilities. The blue components\nare not part of the pywbem or pywbemtools packages.\n\nThe pywbem components all run on the client side and communicate with a\nremote WBEM server using the standard CIM operations over HTTP (CIM-XML)\nprotocol defined by the DMTF.\n\nPywbem provides the following Python APIs:\n\n- [WBEM Client Library](https://pywbem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/client.html) -\n  An API that supports issuing WBEM operations to a WBEM server, using the CIM\n  operations over HTTP (CIM-XML) protocol defined by the DMTF.\n- [WBEM Server Library](https://pywbem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/server.html) -\n  An API that encapsulates selected functionality of a WBEM server for use by a\n  WBEM client application, such as determining the Interop namespace and other\n  basic information about the server, or the management profiles advertised by\n  the server.\n- [WBEM Indication Listener](https://pywbem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/indication.html) -\n  An API for creating and managing a thread-based WBEM listener that waits for\n  indications (i.e. event notifications) emitted by a WBEM server using the\n  CIM-XML protocol. The API supports registering callback functions that get\n  called when indications are received by the listener.\n- [WBEM Subscription Manager](https://pywbem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subscription.html) -\n  An API for viewing and managing subscriptions for indications on a WBEM server.\n- [MOF Compiler](https://pywbem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/compiler.html) -\n  An API for compiling MOF files or strings into a CIM repository (e.g. on a\n  WBEM server), or for test-compiling MOF.\n- [Mock WBEM server](https://pywbem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mockwbemserver.html) -\n  An API for setting up a mocked WBEM server that is used instead of a real WBEM\n  server. This allows setting up well-defined WBEM servers locally that can be\n  used for example for prototyping or testing user applications.\n\nPywbem provides this command line utility:\n\n- [mof_compiler](https://pywbem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/utilities.html#mof-compiler) -\n  A MOF compiler that takes MOF files as input and compiles them into a CIM\n  repository (e.g. on a WBEM server).\n\nThe related [pywbemtools project](https://github.com/pywbem/pywbemtools)\nprovides the following command line utilities:\n\n- [pywbemcli](https://pywbemtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pywbemcli) -\n  A client-side command line interface for a WBEM server, supporting a command\n  line mode and an interactive (repl) mode.\n- [pywbemlistener](https://pywbemtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pywbemlistener) -\n  A command that runs and manages WBEM indication listeners that can receive\n  indications from a WBEM server.\n\n# Installation\n\nTo install the latest released version of pywbem into your active Python\nenvironment:\n\n``` bash\n$ pip install pywbem\n```\n\nThis will also install any prerequisite Python packages.\n\nStarting with version 1.0.0, pywbem has no OS-level prerequisite packages.\n\nOn newer versions of some operating systems(ex. Ubuntu 23.04, Debian 12)\npywbem will only install into a virtual environment. This is by design\nto avoid conflicts between OS distributed python packages and other user\ninstalled packages and is documented in\n[Python PEP 668](https://peps.python.org/pep-0668/). See the pywbem documentation\n[Troubleshooting section](https://pywbem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/appendix.html#troubleshooting)\nfor more information if an \\\"Externally-managed-environment\\\" error\noccurs during installation.\n\nFor more details and alternative ways to install, see the\n[Installation section](https://pywbem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#installation)\nin the pywbem documentation.\n\n# Documentation\n\n- [Documentation](https://pywbem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) -\n  Concepts, tutorials, Python API, command line tools, and developer\n  documentation.\n- [Tutorial](https://pywbem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html) -\n  The tutorials in the documentation are provided as Jupyter notebooks\n  and provide working examples of pywbem API usage.\n- [Change log](https://pywbem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changes.html) -\n  Detailed change history in the documentation.\n- [Presentations](https://pywbem.github.io/pywbem/documentation.html) -\n  status, concepts, and implementation of pywbem.\n\n# Quick Start\n\nThe following simple example script lists the namespaces and the Interop\nnamespace in a particular WBEM server:\n\n``` python\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport pywbem\n\nserver_url = 'http://localhost'\nuser = 'fred'\npassword = 'blah'\n\nconn = pywbem.WBEMConnection(server_url, (user, password))\n\nserver = pywbem.WBEMServer(conn)\n\nprint(f\"Interop namespace:\\n  {server.interop_ns}\")\n\nprint(\"All namespaces:\")\nfor ns in server.namespaces:\n    print(f\"  {ns}\")\n```\n\n# Project Planning\n\nFor each upcoming release, the bugs and feature requests that are planned to be\naddressed in that release are listed in the\n[issue tracker](https://github.com/pywbem/pywbem/issues) with an according\nmilestone set that identifies the target release. The due date on the milestone\ndefinition is the planned release date. There is usually also an issue that\nsets out the major goals for an upcoming release.\n\n# Planned Next Release\n\nFix versions of pywbem are released as needed.\n\nThe next planned feature version(s) of pywbem can be found by listing the\n[release definition issues](https://github.com/pywbem/pywbem/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22release+definition%22).\n\n# Contributing\n\nFor information on how to contribute to pywbem, see the\n[Contributing section](https://pywbem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development.html#contributing)\nin the pywbem documentation.\n\n# License\n\nPywbem is provided under the\n[GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 2.1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pywbem/pywbem/master/LICENSE.txt),\nor (at your option) any later version.\n",

With Spotipy you get full access to all of the music data provided by the Spotify platform.\n\n![Integration tests](https://github.com/spotipy-dev/spotipy/actions/workflows/integration_tests.yml/badge.svg?branch=master) [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/spotipy/badge/?version=master)](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=master) [![Discord server](https://img.shields.io/discord/1244611850700849183?style=flat&logo=discord&logoColor=7289DA&color=7289DA)](https://discord.gg/HP6xcPsTPJ)\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Features](#features)\n- [Installation](#installation)\n- [Quick Start](#quick-start)\n- [Reporting Issues](#reporting-issues)\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\n\n## Features\n\nSpotipy supports all of the features of the Spotify Web API including access to all end points, and support for user authorization. For details on the capabilities you are encouraged to review the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/) documentation.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\npip install spotipy\n```\n\nalternatively, for Windows users \n\n```bash\npy -m pip install spotipy\n```\n\nor upgrade\n\n```bash\npip install spotipy --upgrade\n```\n\n## Quick Start\n\nA full set of examples can be found in the [online documentation](http://spotipy.readthedocs.org/) and in the [Spotipy examples directory](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy/tree/master/examples).\n\nTo get started, [install spotipy](#installation), create a new account or log in on https://developers.spotify.com/. Go to the [dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard), create an app and add your new ID and SECRET (ID and SECRET can be found on an app setting) to your environment ([step-by-step video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaBVN8uP358)):\n\n### Example without user authentication\n\n```python\nimport spotipy\nfrom spotipy.oauth2 import SpotifyClientCredentials\n\nsp = spotipy.Spotify(auth_manager=SpotifyClientCredentials(client_id=\"YOUR_APP_CLIENT_ID\",\n                                                           client_secret=\"YOUR_APP_CLIENT_SECRET\"))\n\nresults = sp.search(q='weezer', limit=20)\nfor idx, track in enumerate(results['tracks']['items']):\n    print(idx, track['name'])\n```\nExpected result:\n```\n0 Island In The Sun\n1 Say It Ain't So\n2 Buddy Holly\n.\n.\n.\n18 Troublemaker\n19 Feels Like Summer\n```\n\n\n### Example with user authentication\n\nA redirect URI must be added to your application at [My Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications) to access user authenticated features.\n\n```python\nimport spotipy\nfrom spotipy.oauth2 import SpotifyOAuth\n\nsp = spotipy.Spotify(auth_manager=SpotifyOAuth(client_id=\"YOUR_APP_CLIENT_ID\",\n                                               client_secret=\"YOUR_APP_CLIENT_SECRET\",\n                                               redirect_uri=\"YOUR_APP_REDIRECT_URI\",\n                                               scope=\"user-library-read\"))\n\nresults = sp.current_user_saved_tracks()\nfor idx, item in enumerate(results['items']):\n    track = item['track']\n    print(idx, track['artists'][0]['name'], \" – \", track['name'])\n```\nExpected result will be the list of music that you liked. For example if you liked Red and Sunflower, the result will be:\n```\n0 Post Malone  –  Sunflower - Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\n1 Taylor Swift  –  Red\n```\n\n\n## Reporting Issues\n\nFor common questions please check our [FAQ](FAQ.md).\n\nYou can ask questions about Spotipy on\n[Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask).\nDon’t forget to add the *Spotipy* tag, and any other relevant tags as well, before posting.\n\nIf you have suggestions, bugs or other issues specific to this library,\nfile them [here](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy/issues).\nOr just send a pull request.\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you are a developer with Python experience, and you would like to contribute to Spotipy, please be sure to follow the guidelines listed on documentation page\n\n> #### [Visit the guideline](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/#contribute)\n",

More details can be found [here](https://github.com/onnx/steering-committee/tree/main/roadmap)\n\n# Installation\n\n## Official Python packages\n\nONNX released packages are published in PyPi.\n\n```sh\npip install onnx  # or pip install onnx[reference] for optional reference implementation dependencies\n```\n\n[ONNX weekly packages](https://pypi.org/project/onnx-weekly/) are published in PyPI to enable experimentation and early testing.\n\n## vcpkg packages\n\nONNX is in the maintenance list of [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg), you can easily use vcpkg to build and install it.\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git\ncd vcpkg\n./bootstrap-vcpkg.bat # For powershell\n./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh # For bash\n./vcpkg install onnx\n```\n\n## Conda packages\n\nA binary build of ONNX is available from [Conda](https://conda.io), in [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/):\n\n```sh\nconda install -c conda-forge onnx\n```\n\n## Build ONNX from Source\n\nBefore building from source uninstall any existing versions of ONNX `pip uninstall onnx`.\n\nC++17 or higher C++ compiler version is required to build ONNX from source. Still, users can specify their own `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD` version for building ONNX.\n\nIf you don't have protobuf installed, ONNX will internally download and build protobuf for ONNX build.\n\nOr, you can manually install [protobuf C/C++ libraries and tools](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf) with specified version before proceeding forward. Then depending on how you installed protobuf, you need to set environment variable CMAKE_ARGS to \"-DONNX_USE_PROTOBUF_SHARED_LIBS=ON\" or \"-DONNX_USE_PROTOBUF_SHARED_LIBS=OFF\".  For example, you may need to run the following command:\n\nLinux:\n\n```sh\nexport CMAKE_ARGS=\"-DONNX_USE_PROTOBUF_SHARED_LIBS=ON\"\n```\n\nWindows:\n\n```bat\nset CMAKE_ARGS=\"-DONNX_USE_PROTOBUF_SHARED_LIBS=ON\"\n```\n\nThe ON/OFF depends on what kind of protobuf library you have. Shared libraries are files ending with \\*.dll/\\*.so/\\*.dylib. Static libraries are files ending with \\*.a/\\*.lib. This option depends on how you get your protobuf library and how it was built. And it is default OFF. You don't need to run the commands above if you'd prefer to use a static protobuf library.\n\n### Windows\n\nIf you are building ONNX from source, it is recommended that you also build Protobuf locally as a static library. The version distributed with conda-forge is a DLL, but ONNX expects it to be a static library. Building protobuf locally also lets you control the version of protobuf. The tested and recommended version is 3.21.12.\n\nThe instructions in this README assume you are using Visual Studio.  It is recommended that you run all the commands from a shell started from \"x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2019\" and keep the build system generator for cmake (e.g., cmake -G \"Visual Studio 16 2019\") consistent while building protobuf as well as ONNX.\n\nYou can get protobuf by running the following commands:\n\n```bat\ngit clone https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf.git\ncd protobuf\ngit checkout v21.12\ncd cmake\ncmake -G \"Visual Studio 16 2019\" -A x64 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<protobuf_install_dir> -Dprotobuf_MSVC_STATIC_RUNTIME=OFF -Dprotobuf_BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -Dprotobuf_BUILD_TESTS=OFF -Dprotobuf_BUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF .\nmsbuild protobuf.sln /m /p:Configuration=Release\nmsbuild INSTALL.vcxproj /p:Configuration=Release\n```\n\nThen it will be built as a static library and installed to <protobuf_install_dir>. Please add the bin directory(which contains protoc.exe) to your PATH.\n\n```bat\nset CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<protobuf_install_dir>;%CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH%\n```\n\nPlease note: if your protobuf_install_dir contains spaces, **do not** add quotation marks around it.\n\nAlternative: if you don't want to change your PATH, you can set ONNX_PROTOC_EXECUTABLE instead.\n\n```bat\nset CMAKE_ARGS=-DONNX_PROTOC_EXECUTABLE=<full_path_to_protoc.exe>\n```\n\nThen you can build ONNX as:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/onnx/onnx.git\ncd onnx\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\n# prefer lite proto\nset CMAKE_ARGS=-DONNX_USE_LITE_PROTO=ON\npip install -e . -v\n```\n\n### Linux\n\nFirst, you need to install protobuf. The minimum Protobuf compiler (protoc) version required by ONNX is 3.6.1. Please note that old protoc versions might not work with `CMAKE_ARGS=-DONNX_USE_LITE_PROTO=ON`.\n\nUbuntu 20.04 (and newer) users may choose to install protobuf via\n\n```sh\napt-get install python3-pip python3-dev libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler\n```\n\nIn this case, it is required to add `-DONNX_USE_PROTOBUF_SHARED_LIBS=ON` to CMAKE_ARGS in the ONNX build step.\n\nA more general way is to build and install it from source. See the instructions below for more details.\n\n<details>\n  <summary> Installing Protobuf from source </summary>\n\n  Debian/Ubuntu:\n\n  ```sh\n    git clone https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf.git\n    cd protobuf\n    git checkout v21.12\n    git submodule update --init --recursive\n    mkdir build_source && cd build_source\n    cmake ../cmake -Dprotobuf_BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_INSTALL_SYSCONFDIR=/etc -DCMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE=ON -Dprotobuf_BUILD_TESTS=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release\n    make -j$(nproc)\n    make install\n  ```\n\n  CentOS/RHEL/Fedora:\n\n  ```sh\n    git clone https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf.git\n    cd protobuf\n    git checkout v21.12\n    git submodule update --init --recursive\n    mkdir build_source && cd build_source\n    cmake ../cmake  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR=lib64 -Dprotobuf_BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_INSTALL_SYSCONFDIR=/etc -DCMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE=ON -Dprotobuf_BUILD_TESTS=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release\n    make -j$(nproc)\n    make install\n  ```\n\n  Here \"-DCMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE=ON\" is crucial. By default static libraries are built without \"-fPIC\" flag, they are not position independent code. But shared libraries must be position independent code. Python C/C++ extensions(like ONNX) are shared libraries. So if a static library was not built with \"-fPIC\", it can't be linked to such a shared library.\n\n  Once build is successful, update PATH to include protobuf paths.\n\n</details>\n\nThen you can build ONNX as:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/onnx/onnx.git\ncd onnx\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\n# Optional: prefer lite proto\nexport CMAKE_ARGS=-DONNX_USE_LITE_PROTO=ON\npip install -e . -v\n```\n\n### Mac\n\n```sh\nexport NUM_CORES=`sysctl -n hw.ncpu`\nbrew update\nbrew install autoconf && brew install automake\nwget https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/v21.12/protobuf-cpp-3.21.12.tar.gz\ntar -xvf protobuf-cpp-3.21.12.tar.gz\ncd protobuf-3.21.12\nmkdir build_source && cd build_source\ncmake ../cmake -Dprotobuf_BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DCMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE=ON -Dprotobuf_BUILD_TESTS=OFF -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release\nmake -j${NUM_CORES}\nmake install\n```\n\nOnce build is successful, update PATH to include protobuf paths.\n\nThen you can build ONNX as:\n\n```sh\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/onnx/onnx.git\ncd onnx\n# Optional: prefer lite proto\nset CMAKE_ARGS=-DONNX_USE_LITE_PROTO=ON\npip install -e . -v\n```\n\n## Verify Installation\n\nAfter installation, run\n\n```sh\npython -c \"import onnx\"\n```\n\nto verify it works.\n\n## Common Build Options\n\nFor full list refer to CMakeLists.txt\n\n### Environment variables\n\n* `USE_MSVC_STATIC_RUNTIME` should be 1 or 0, not ON or OFF. When set to 1 ONNX links statically to runtime library.\n**Default**: `USE_MSVC_STATIC_RUNTIME=0`\n\n* `DEBUG` should be 0 or 1. When set to 1 ONNX is built in debug mode. or debug versions of the dependencies, you need to open the [CMakeLists file](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/CMakeLists.txt) and append a letter `d` at the end of the package name lines. For example, `NAMES protobuf-lite` would become `NAMES protobuf-lited`.\n**Default**: `Debug=0`\n\n### CMake variables\n\n* `ONNX_USE_PROTOBUF_SHARED_LIBS` should be `ON` or `OFF`.\n**Default**: `ONNX_USE_PROTOBUF_SHARED_LIBS=OFF USE_MSVC_STATIC_RUNTIME=0`\n`ONNX_USE_PROTOBUF_SHARED_LIBS` determines how ONNX links to protobuf libraries.\n  * When set to `ON` - ONNX will dynamically link to protobuf shared libs, PROTOBUF_USE_DLLS will be defined as described [here](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/main/cmake/README.md#dlls-vs-static-linking).\n  * When set to `OFF` - ONNX will link statically to protobuf.\n\n* `ONNX_USE_LITE_PROTO` should be `ON` or `OFF`. When set to `ON` ONNX uses lite protobuf instead of full protobuf.\n**Default**: `ONNX_USE_LITE_PROTO=OFF`\n\n* `ONNX_WERROR` should be `ON` or `OFF`. When set to `ON` warnings are treated as errors.\n**Default**: `ONNX_WERROR=OFF` in local builds, `ON` in CI and release pipelines.\n\n## Common Errors\n\n* Note: the `import onnx` command does not work from the source checkout directory; in this case you'll see `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'onnx.onnx_cpp2py_export'`. Change into another directory to fix this error.\n\n* If you run into any issues while building Protobuf as a static library, please ensure that shared Protobuf libraries, like libprotobuf, are not installed on your device or in the conda environment. If these shared libraries exist, either remove them to build Protobuf from source as a static library, or skip the Protobuf build from source to use the shared version directly.\n\n* If you run into any issues while building ONNX from source, and your error message reads, `Could not find pythonXX.lib`, ensure that you have consistent Python versions for common commands, such as `python` and `pip`. Clean all existing build files and rebuild ONNX again.\n\n# Testing\n\nONNX uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org) as test driver. In order to run tests, you will first need to install `pytest`:\n\n```sh\npip install pytest nbval\n```\n\nAfter installing pytest, use the following command to run tests.\n\n```sh\npytest\n```\n\n# Development\n\nCheck out the [contributor guide](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions.\n\n# License\n\n[Apache License v2.0](LICENSE)\n\n# Code of Conduct\n\n[ONNX Open Source Code of Conduct](https://onnx.ai/codeofconduct.html)\n",

ONNX 1.13 release will probably happen this Nov. or Dec so I would say it will only be included in future release instead of a patch release for current 1.12. However, for now I am even not sure whether this PR will be included in next 1.13 since this PR will upgrade ONNX's minimum supported version of Python Protobuf (3.12.2 -> 3.20.0). I will need more time to investigate whether it is OK for other ONNX related tools. May I understand your demand?

Here is another security issue when loading external tensors on Windows:\r\nOn Linux, a path string is either encoded by Unicode(UTF-16), or a multiple byte encoding like GB18030/ISO-8859-1/…, and usually it is not UTF-8.  As there are so many encodings, usually we need to convert the string to UTF-16 first and process it with wchar_t. Otherwise, when you search the char ‘\\’, you may accidently misclassify a half of a Chinese character to ‘\\’. (It can happen in other encodings too). On Linux, the same thing could happen too, but we could claim on Linux we don’t support locales other than xxx.UTF-8. But for Windows, we need to handle other encodings. Using filesystem could be a solution.",

ONNX 1.13 release will probably happen this Nov. or Dec so I would say it will only be included in future release instead of a patch release for current 1.12. However, for now I am even not sure whether this PR will be included in next 1.13 since this PR will upgrade ONNX's minimum supported version of Python Protobuf (3.12.2 -> 3.20.0). I will need more time to investigate whether it is OK for other ONNX related tools. May I understand your demand?

As there are so many encodings, usually we need to convert the string to UTF-16 first and process it with wchar_t. Otherwise, when you search the char ‘\\’, you may accidently misclassify a half of a Chinese character to ‘\\’. (It can happen in other encodings too). On Linux, the same thing could happen too, but we could claim on Linux we don’t support locales other than xxx.UTF-8. But for Windows, we need to handle other encodings. Using filesystem could be a solution.",

Most versions of the Windows operating system search the current directory first\r\nwhen attempting to load files. If you do not specify a fully qualified pathname when loading\r\na Windows dynamic load library (DLL), the loader will attempt to locate the library in the\r\ncurrent directory. If there is a malicious library located in the current directory, it will be\r\nloaded instead of the intended library.\r\n",

AGE is an acronym for A Graph Extension and is inspired by Bitnine's AgensGraph, a multi-model database fork of PostgreSQL. The basic principle of the project is to create a single storage that handles both the relational and graph data model so that the users can use the standard ANSI SQL along with openCypher, one of the most popular graph query languages today. There is a strong need for cohesive, easy-to-implement multi-model databases. As an extension of PostgreSQL, AGE supports all the functionalities and features of PostgreSQL while also offering a graph model to boot.\n</br>\n</br>\n</br>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"/img/age-01.png\" width=\"80%\" height=\"80%\">\n</p>\n\n</br>\n\n\n<h2><img height=\"30\" src=\"/img/tick.svg\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Overview</h2>\n\nApache AGE is :\n\n- **Powerful**: adds graph database support to the already popular PostgreSQL database: PostgreSQL is used by organizations including Apple, Spotify, and NASA.\n- **Flexible**: allows you to perform openCypher queries, which makes complex queries much easier to write. It also enables querying multiple graphs at the same time.\n- **Intelligent**: allows you to perform graph queries that are the basis for many next-level web services such as fraud detection, master data management, product recommendations, identity and relationship management, experience personalization, knowledge management, and more.\n\n<h2><img height=\"30\" src=\"/img/features.svg\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Features</h2>\n</br>\n</br>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"/img/age-03.png\" width=\"80%\" height=\"80%\">\n</p>\n</br>\n\n- **Cypher Query**: supports graph query language\n- **Hybrid Querying**: enables SQL and/or Cypher\n- **Querying**: enables multiple graphs\n- **Hierarchical**: graph label organization\n- **Property Indexes**: on both vertices(nodes) and edges\n- **Full PostgreSQL**: supports PG features\n\n\n\n<h2><img height=\"30\" src=\"/img/documentation.svg\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Documentation</h2>\n\nRefer to our latest [Apache AGE documentation](https://age.apache.org/age-manual/master/index.html) to learn about installation, features, built-in functions, and  Cypher queries.\n\n\n\n<h2><img height=\"30\" src=\"/img/installation.svg\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Pre-Installation</h2>\n\nInstall the following essential libraries according to each OS. Building AGE from the source depends on the following Linux libraries (Ubuntu package names shown below):\n\n- **CentOS**\n```bash\nyum install gcc glibc glib-common readline readline-devel zlib zlib-devel flex bison\n```\n- **Fedora**\n```bash\ndnf install gcc glibc bison flex readline readline-devel zlib zlib-devel\n```\n- **Ubuntu**\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install build-essential libreadline-dev zlib1g-dev flex bison\n```\n\n<h2><img height=\"30\" src=\"/img/installation.svg\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Installation</h2>\n\nApache AGE is intended to be simple to install and run. It can be installed with Docker and other traditional ways. \n\n<h4><a><img width=\"20\" src=\"/img/pg.svg\"></a>\n&nbsp;Install PostgreSQL\n</h4>\n\nYou will need to install an AGE compatible version of Postgres<a>, for now AGE supports Postgres 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 & 16. Supporting the latest versions is on AGE roadmap.\n\n<h4>\n&nbsp;Installation via Package Manager\n</h4>\n\nYou can use a <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/download/\">package management </a> that your OS provides to download PostgreSQL.\n\n<br>\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install postgresql\n\n```\n<h4>\n&nbsp;Installation From Source Code\n</h4>\n\nYou can <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/ftp/source/\"> download the Postgres </a> source code and install your own instance of Postgres. You can read instructions on how to install from source code for different versions on the <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/installation.html\">official Postgres Website.</a>\n\n\n\n<h4><img width=\"20\" src=\"/img/tux.svg\"><img width=\"20\" src=\"/img/apple.svg\"> &nbsp;Install AGE on Linux and MacOS\n</h4>\n\nClone the <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/age\">github repository</a> or download the <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/age/releases\">download an official release.\n</a>\nRun the pg_config utility and check the version of PostgreSQL. Currently, only PostgreSQL versions 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 & 16 are supported. If you have any other version of Postgres, you will need to install PostgreSQL version 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, or 16.\n<br>\n    \n```bash\npg_config\n```\nRun the following command in the source code directory of Apache AGE to build and install the extension.  \n     \n```bash\nmake install\n```\n     \nIf the path to your Postgres installation is not in the PATH variable, add the path in the arguments:\n```bash\nmake PG_CONFIG=/path/to/postgres/bin/pg_config install\n```\n\n\n<h4></a><img width=\"30\" src=\"/img/docker.svg\"></a>\n&nbsp;Run using Docker\n</h4>\n\n<h5> Get the docker image </h5>\n\n```bash\ndocker pull apache/age\n\n```\n<h5> Create AGE docker container </h5>\n\n```bash\ndocker run \\\n    --name age  \\\n    -p 5455:5432 \\\n    -e POSTGRES_USER=postgresUser \\\n    -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgresPW \\\n    -e POSTGRES_DB=postgresDB \\\n    -d \\\n    apache/age\n```\n\n<h5> Enter PostgreSQL's psql: </h5>\n\n```bash\ndocker exec -it age psql -d postgresDB -U postgresUser\n```\n\n\n\n<h2><img height=\"20\" src=\"/img/contents.svg\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Post Installation</h2>\n\nFor every connection of AGE you start, you will need to load the AGE extension.\n\n```bash\nCREATE EXTENSION age;\n```\n```bash\nLOAD 'age';\n```\n```bash\nSET search_path = ag_catalog, \"$user\", public;\n```\n\n\n\n<h2><img height=\"20\" src=\"/img/contents.svg\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Quick Start</h2>\n\nTo create a graph, use the create_graph function located in the ag_catalog namespace.\n\n```bash\nSELECT create_graph('graph_name');\n```\n\nTo create a single vertex with label and properties, use the CREATE clause.\n\n```bash\nSELECT * \nFROM cypher('graph_name', $$\n    CREATE (:label {property:\"Node A\"})\n$$) as (v agtype);\n```\n\n```bash\nSELECT * \nFROM cypher('graph_name', $$\n    CREATE (:label {property:\"Node B\"})\n$$) as (v agtype);\n```\n\nTo create an edge between two nodes and set its properties:\n\n```bash\nSELECT * \nFROM cypher('graph_name', $$\n    MATCH (a:label), (b:label)\n    WHERE a.property = 'Node A' AND b.property = 'Node B'\n    CREATE (a)-[e:RELTYPE {property:a.property + '<->' + b.property}]->(b)\n    RETURN e\n$$) as (e agtype);\n```\n\nAnd to query the connected nodes:\n\n```\nSELECT * from cypher('graph_name', $$\n        MATCH (V)-[R]-(V2)\n        RETURN V,R,V2\n$$) as (V agtype, R agtype, V2 agtype);\n```\n\n<h2><img height=\"20\" src=\"/img/gettingstarted.svg\">&nbsp;&nbsp;Language Specific Drivers</h2>\n\nStarting with Apache AGE is very simple.
